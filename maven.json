For services that operate with multiple users, this can result in one user's <code>Cookie</code> being used for another user's requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>This issue is described without security warnings here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1964\">https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1964</a></p>\n<p>I already have a PR to fix this issue:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/pull/2033\">https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/pull/2033</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Add an auth <code>Cookie</code> to the <code>CookieStore</code><ul>\n<li>This is identical to receiving an HTTP response that uses <code>Set-Cookie</code>, as shown in issue #1964 above.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Handle a different user's request where the same <code>Cookie</code> is provided as a passthrough, like a JWT, and attempt to use it by explicitly providing it.</li>\n<li>Observe that the user's cookie in step 2 is passed as the Cookie in step 1.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This is generally going to be a problem for developers of backend services that implement third party auth features and use other features like token refresh. The moment a third party service responds by <em>setting</em> a cookie in the response, the <code>CookieStore</code> will effectively break almost every follow-up request (hopefully by being rejected, but possibly by revealing a different user's information).</p>\n<p>If your service sets cookies based on the response that happens here, it's possible to lead to even greater levels of exposure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/security/advisories/GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv\">https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/security/advisories/GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53990\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53990</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1964\">https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1964</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/pull/2033\">https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/pull/2033</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/commit/d5a83362f7aed81b93ebca559746ac9be0f95425\">https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/commit/d5a83362f7aed81b93ebca559746ac9be0f95425</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
