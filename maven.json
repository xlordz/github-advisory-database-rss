Also examine connector dependencies for \nvulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally,\nin addition to leveraging the \"org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules\" system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector\nclient config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which cannot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27818\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27818</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/cve-list\">https://kafka.apache.org/cve-list</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/09/2\">http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/09/2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-76qp-h5mr-frr4\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-76qp-h5mr-frr4</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to connect to the Kafka cluster and have the AlterConfigs permission on the cluster resource.</p>\n<p>Since Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property (\"-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules\") to disable the problematic login modules usage in SASL JAAS configuration.
