This issue occurs when an alias loop exists in the LDAP database. If an <code>ldapsearch</code> request is executed with alias dereferencing set to \"always\" on this alias entry, the server stops responding to all future requests.\nI have confirmed this issue using the latest OpenDJ version (9.2), both with the official OpenDJ Docker image and a local OpenDJ server running on my Windows 10 machine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a single crafted <code>ldapsearch</code> request. Fortunately, the server can be restarted without data corruption. While this attack requires the existence of an alias loop, I am uncertain whether such loops can be easily created in specific environments or if the method can be adapted to execute other DoS attacks more easily.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc-steps-to-reproduce\">PoC (Steps to Reproduce)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Set up an OpenDJ server instance as usual, using the base DN <code>dc=example,dc=com</code></li>\n<li>Import the attached <code>example_data_alias_dos.ldif</code> file into the LDAP database</li>\n<li>Ensure that the <code>ldap3</code> Python library is installed (<code>pip install ldap3</code>)</li>\n<li>Run the attached Python script <code>python opendj_alias_dos.py</code>, which searches for alias loops and executes the DoS attack</li>\n<li>After executing the script, the server will stop responding to requests until it is restarted</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability directly affects server availability for everyone using it. A single <code>ldapsearch</code> request on an alias loop entry can cause the entire server to become unresponsive, requiring a restart. The issue can be repeatedly triggered.
