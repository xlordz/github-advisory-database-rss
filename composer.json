While query parameters are encrypted when using TLS, many webservers (including ones officially documented for use with Pterodactyl) will log query parameters in plain-text, storing a user's password in plain text.</p>\n<p>If a malicious user obtains access to these logs they could <em>potentially</em> authenticate against a user's account; assuming they are able to discover the account's email address or username <strong>separately</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This problem has been patched by <a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1</a> on the <code>1.0-develop</code> branch and released under <code>v1.11.8</code> as a single commit on top of <code>v1.11.7</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/75b59080e2812ced677dab516222b2a3bb34e3a4\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/75b59080e2812ced677dab516222b2a3bb34e3a4</a></p>\n<p>Patch file: <a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1.patch\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1.patch</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>There are no workarounds at this time.  There is not a direct vulnerability within the software as it relates to logs generated by intermediate components such as webservers or Layer 7 proxies.</p>\n<p>Updating to <code>v1.11.8</code> or adding the linked patch manually are the only ways to avoid this problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-notice\">User Notice</h3>\n<p>As this vulnerability relates to historical logging of sensitive data, users who have ever disabled 2FA on a Panel (self-hosted or operated by a company) should change their passwords and consider enabling 2FA if it was left disabled.  While it's unlikely that your account will be compromised by this vulnerability, it's not impossible.</p>\n<p>Panel administrators should consider clearing any access logs that may contain sensitive data, for Panels using NGINX, the access log is located at <code>/var/log/nginx/pterodactyl.app-access.log</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-c479-wq8g-57hr\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-c479-wq8g-57hr</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/75b59080e2812ced677dab516222b2a3bb34e3a4\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/75b59080e2812ced677dab516222b2a3bb34e3a4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1\">https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/8be2b892c3940bdc0157ccdab16685a72d105dd1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49762\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49762</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c479-wq8g-57hr\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c479-wq8g-57hr</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
