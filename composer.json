Who is impacted?</em></p>\n<p>Remote code execution is possible in web-accessible installations of hypercube. </p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em></p>\n<p>Not yet, though no patch is neccessary if your installation of the microservices is behind a firewall.  See below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em></p>\n<p>The exploit requires making a request against Hypercube's endpoints; therefore, the ability to make use of the exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Hypercube.  Furthermore, if you've used any of the official installation methods, your Crayfish will be behind a firewall and there is no work neccessary.</p>\n<p>The webserver might be made to validate the structure of headers passed, but that would only be neccessary if you publicly exposed the endpoint. Standard security practices should be applied.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p><em>Are there any links users can visit to find out more?</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>XBOW-024-074</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f\">https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
