However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces.</p>\n<p>As a result, even with the secure configuration shown above, an attacker can inject dangerous attributes into applications using this extension via a payload such as:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-md\">![](){onerror=alert(1)}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which results in the following HTML:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img onerror=\"alert(1)\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which causes the JS to execute immediately on page load.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All attributes starting with <code>on</code> are considered unsafe and blocked by default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.7/extensions/attributes/#configuration\">Support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes</a></li>\n<li>Manually-added <code>href</code> and <code>src</code> attributes now respect the existing <code>allow_unsafe_links</code> configuration option</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>If upgrading is not feasible, please consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabling the <code>AttributesExtension</code> for untrusted users</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/security/#additional-filtering\">Filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/security/advisories/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx\">https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/security/advisories/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/commit/f0d626cf05ad3e99e6db26ebcb9091b6cd1cd89b\">https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/commit/f0d626cf05ad3e99e6db26ebcb9091b6cd1cd89b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46734\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46734</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
