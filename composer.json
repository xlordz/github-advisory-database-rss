Due to the lack of ongoing support and updates, potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with its continued use. To mitigate these risks and enhance the overall security of the CKEditor 4, we have decided to completely remove the GeSHi library as a dependency. This change aims to maintain a secure environment and reduce the risk of any security incidents related to outdated or unsupported software.</p>\n<p>To integrators who still want to use the GeSHi syntax highlighter, we recommend manually adding the <a href=\"https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0\">GeSHi library</a> .

Who is impacted?</em></p>\n<p>Remote code execution is possible in web-accessible installations of hypercube. </p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p><em>Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?</em></p>\n<p>Not yet, though no patch is neccessary if your installation of the microservices is behind a firewall.  See below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em></p>\n<p>The exploit requires making a request against Hypercube's endpoints; therefore, the ability to make use of the exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Hypercube.  Furthermore, if you've used any of the official installation methods, your Crayfish will be behind a firewall and there is no work neccessary.</p>\n<p>The webserver might be made to validate the structure of headers passed, but that would only be neccessary if you publicly exposed the endpoint. Standard security practices should be applied.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p><em>Are there any links users can visit to find out more?</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>XBOW-024-074</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f\">https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2p2-hgjg-9r3f</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
