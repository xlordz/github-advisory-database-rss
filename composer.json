Snippet paths that point outside of the snippets root will not be loaded.</p>\n<h3 id=\"effects-on-site-code\">Effects on site code</h3>\n<p>If you deliberately use path traversal in your projects, these uses will break after updating to one of the patched versions.</p>\n<p>Examples of such uses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aliasing a template by loading another template with <code>snippet('../templates/other-template')</code>. Robust alternatives are to use <code>require __DIR__ . '/other-template.php'</code> or to override the <code>$page-&gt;template()</code> method in the page model:<pre><code class=\"language-php\">class AnotherPage extends Page\n{\n  public function template(): Template\n  {\n    return $this-&gt;kirby()-&gt;template('other-template');\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>Loading a snippet from a shared directory in a multisite setup. A robust alternative is to restructure the project so that all sites share a single snippets root that then branches off into subdirectories for each site. If you prefer to keep the original structure, you can use symbolic links (symlinks) in the file system to include the shared directory in the site-specific snippets roots.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Bruno Meilick (@bnomei) for reporting the identified issue.\nThanks to Bruno Meilick and Tobias Möritz (@tobimori) for their input on the effects on site code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-fw82-87p8-v6hp\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-fw82-87p8-v6hp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30159\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30159</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/90acf7ed6d8d9d0697f938edc0940b4a563ddbe7\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/90acf7ed6d8d9d0697f938edc0940b4a563ddbe7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.10.1.2\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.10.1.2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.8.3\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.8.3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.7.1\">https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.7.1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fw82-87p8-v6hp\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fw82-87p8-v6hp</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

By using special elements such as <code>..</code> and <code>/</code> separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the <code>../</code> sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location.</p>\n<p>Because Kirby's <code>collection()</code> helper did not protect against path traversal, the provided collection name could include special sequences that would cause Kirby to look outside of the configured collections root and access arbitrary files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation.
