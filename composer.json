Even though the actual data change is minimal, the error is unrecoverable until a valid role parameter is restored by direct modification of the user account file.\nProper validation of select fields will prevent extraneous valid from being accepted and making the entire site and administration panel unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/d9f0c1feb3b9855d5bdc8bb189c0aaab2792e7ca\"><strong>Formwork 2.x</strong> (d9f0c1f)</a> adds proper validation to select fields.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The condition for this attack is having high privileges or Admin access, which means it could be exploited by an Insider Threat.
