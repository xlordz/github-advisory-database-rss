        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>This advisory follows the security advisory <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j">GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j published by the <em>yt-dlp/yt-dlp</em> project</a> to aid remediation of the issue in the <em>ytdl-org/youtube-dl</em> project.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h3>
<p><em>youtube-dl</em> does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Since <em>youtube-dl</em> also reads config from the working directory (and, on Windows, executables will be executed from the <em>youtube-dl</em> directory by default) the vulnerability could allow the unwanted execution of local code, including downloads masquerading as, eg, subtitles.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The versions of <em>youtube-dl</em> listed as <em>Patched</em> remediate this vulnerability by disallowing path separators and whitelisting allowed extensions. As a result, some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Any/all of the below considerations may limit exposure in case it is necessary to use a vulnerable version</p>
<ul>
<li>have <code>.%(ext)s</code> at the end of the output template</li>
<li>download from websites that you trust</li>
<li>do not download to a directory within the executable search <code>PATH</code> or other sensitive locations, such as your user directory or system directories</li>
<li>in Windows versions that support it, set <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50118548"><code>NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath</code></a> to prevent the <em>cmd</em> shell's executable search adding the default directory before <code>PATH</code></li>
<li>consider that the path traversal vulnerability as a result of resolving <code>non_existent_dir\..\..\target</code> does not exist in Linux or macOS</li>
<li>ensure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/... one (use <code>--get-filename</code>)</li>
<li>omit any of the subtitle options (<code>--write-subs</code>/<code> --write-srt</code>, <code>--write-auto-subs</code>/<code>--write-automatic-subs</code>, <code>--all-subs</code>).</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>I found a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the PyTorch. When load model using torch.load with weights_only=True, it can still achieve RCE.  </p>
<h1 id="background-knowledge">Background knowledge</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security">https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security</a> 
 As you can see, the PyTorch official documentation considers using <code>torch.load()</code> with <code>weights_only=True</code> to be safe.
<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdaa8520-d66a-473a-ab1f-163d793de298">
Since everyone knows that weights_only=False is unsafe, so they will use the  weights_only=True to mitigate the security issue.
But now, I just proved that even if you use weights_only=True, it still can achieve RCE.
So it is time to update your PyTorch version~.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
<p>A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa Pro where voice connectors in Rasa Pro do not properly implement authentication even when a token is configured in the <code>credentials.yml</code> file. This could allow an attacker to submit voice data to the Rasa Pro assistant from an unauthenticated source.</p>
<p>This impacts the following connectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>audiocodes_stream</code></li>
<li><code>genesys</code></li>
<li><code>jambonz</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our investigation to resolve this issue, we have also performed a security review of our other voice channel connectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>browser_audio</code>: Does not support authentication. This is a development channel not intended for production use.</li>
<li><code>twilio_media_streams</code>, <code>twilio_voice</code> and <code>jambonz</code>: Authentication is currently not supported by these channels, but our investigation has found a way for us to enable it for these voice channel connectors in a future Rasa Pro release.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fix">Fix</h2>
<p>The issue has been resolved for <code>audiocodes</code>, <code>audiocodes_stream</code>, and <code>genesys</code> connectors. Fixed versions of Rasa Pro have been released for <code>3.9.20</code>, <code>3.10.19</code>, <code>3.11.7</code> and <code>3.12.6</code>. Please update to a fixed release.</p>
<p>If you are using one of the affected connectors, we strongly recommend upgrading to a fixed version. For connectors where authentication is not supported (e.g., Twilio), we suggest taking extra caution and considering other compensating controls if applicable.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>This report is to highlight a vulnerability in XGrammar, a library used by the structured output feature in vLLM. The XGrammar advisory is here: <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-67px-mjg3">https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-67px-mjg3</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://xgrammar.mlc.ai/docs/">xgrammar</a> library is the default backend used by vLLM to support structured output (a.k.a. guided decoding). Xgrammar provides a required, built-in cache for its compiled grammars stored in RAM. xgrammar is available by default through the OpenAI compatible API server with both the V0 and V1 engines.</p>
<p>A malicious user can send a stream of very short decoding requests with unique schemas, resulting in an addition to the cache for each request. This can result in a Denial of Service by consuming all of the system's RAM.</p>
<p>Note that even if vLLM was configured to use a different backend by default, it is still possible to choose xgrammar on a per-request basis using the <code>guided_decoding_backend</code> key of the <code>extra_body</code> field of the request with the V0 engine. This per-request choice is not available when using the V1 engine. </p>

</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>There is no way to workaround this issue in existing versions of vLLM other than preventing untrusted access to the OpenAI compatible API server.</p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m67m-3p5g-cw9j</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m67m-3p5g-cw9j"/>
        <updated>2025-04-15T21:42:21.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>When creating a new component from an existing component that has a source code repository URL specified in settings, this URL is included in the client's URL parameters during the creation process. If, for example, the source code repository URL contains GitHub credentials, the confidential PAT and username are shown in plaintext and get saved into browser history. Moreover, if the request URL is logged, the credentials are written to the logs in plaintext.</p>
<p>The problematic URL in question is of this form:</p>
<pre><code>https://&lt;HOST&gt;/create/component/vcs/?repo=https%3A%2F%2F&lt;GITHUB USERNAME&gt;%3A&lt;GITHUB PAT&gt;%40github.com%2F&lt;REPOSITORY OWNER&gt;%2F&lt;REPOSITORY NAME&gt;.git&amp;project=1&amp;category=&amp;name=&lt;REDACTED&gt;&amp;slug=&lt;REDACTED&gt;&amp;is_glossary=False&amp;vcs=github&amp;source_language=228&amp;license=&amp;source_component=1#existing
</code></pre>
<p>If using Weblate official Docker image, nginx logs the URL and the token in plaintext:</p>
<pre><code>nginx stdout | 127.0.0.1 - - [04/Apr/2025:10:46:54 +0000] "GET /create/component/vcs/?repo=https%3A%2F%2F&lt;GITHUB USERNAME&gt;%3A&lt;GITHUB PAT&gt;%40github.com%2F&lt;REPOSITORY OWNER&gt;%2F&lt;REPOSITORY NAME&gt;.git&amp;project=1&amp;category=&amp;name=&lt;REDACTED&gt;&amp;slug=&lt;REDACTED&gt;&amp;is_glossary=False&amp;vcs=github&amp;source_language=228&amp;license=&amp;source_component=1 HTTP/1.1" 200 17625 "&lt;REDACTED&gt;" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:136.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/136.0"
</code></pre>
<h3 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a project, create a component which has the <em>Repository push URL</em> setting configured with, for example, a GitHub repository URL including a username and a PAT.</li>
<li>In the same project, create another component using the <em>From existing component</em> option and selecting the previous component as the source. Click <em>Continue</em>.</li>
<li>Observe that the URL parameter <code>repo</code> includes the secret PAT configured in the original components settings. The URL with the token is potentially saved as plaintext in browser history and server logs.</li>
<li>Select a translation file to import and click <em>Continue</em>.</li>
<li>Observe again the same <code>repo</code> parameter in the URL.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>If server logs are compromised, the attacker may be able to gain access to private repositories potentially containing sensitive source code.</li>
<li>Under common browser settings, the URL containing VCS credentials is saved into browser history. Browser extensions, for example, are often able to read the history and thus offer a realistic attack vector to gain access to the credentials.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><code>jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy</code> was meant to rely on UNIX sockets readable only by the current user since version 3.0.0, but when used with TigerVNC, the VNC server started by <code>jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy</code> were still accessible via the network.</p>
<p>This vulnerability does not affect users having TurboVNC as the <code>vncserver</code> executable.</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>This vulnerability was identified by Arne Gottwald at University of Göttingen and analyzed, reported, and reviewed by @frejanordsiek.</p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-389x-67px-mjg3</id>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Xgrammar includes a cache for compiled grammars to increase performance with repeated use of the same grammar. This cache is held in memory. Since the cache is unbounded, a system making use of xgrammar can be abused to fill up a host's memory and case a denial of service. For example, sending many small requests to an LLM inference server with unique JSON schemas would eventually cause this denial of service to occur.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>The fix is to add a limit to the cache size. This was done in <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/pull/243">https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/pull/243</a></p>
<p>An example of making use of the new cache size limit can be found in vLLM here: <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/16283">https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/16283</a></p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Any system making use of Xgrammar and taking requests as input from potentially untrusted parties would be vulnerable to this denial of service issue.</p>
