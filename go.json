Requesting a virtual document through the Data API entails policy evaluation, where a Rego query containing a single data document <a href=\"https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#references\">reference</a> is constructed from the requested path. This query is then used for policy evaluation.</p>\n<p>A HTTP request path can be crafted in a way that injects Rego code into the constructed query. The evaluation result cannot be made to return any other data than what is generated by the requested path, but this path can be misdirected, and the injected Rego code can be crafted to make the query succeed or fail; opening up for oracle attacks or, given the right circumstances, erroneous policy decision results. Furthermore, the injected code can be crafted to be computationally expensive, resulting in a Denial Of Service (DoS) attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Users are only impacted if all of the following apply:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OPA is deployed as a standalone server (rather than being used as a Go library)</li>\n<li>The OPA server is exposed outside of the local host in an untrusted environment.</li>\n<li>The configured <a href=\"https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization\">authorization policy</a> does not do exact matching of the <code>input.path</code> attribute when deciding if the request should be allowed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>or, if all of the following apply:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OPA is deployed as a standalone server.</li>\n<li>The service connecting to OPA allows 3rd parties to insert unsanitised text into the path of the HTTP request to OPA’s Data API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> With <strong>no</strong> Authorization Policy configured for restricting API access (the default configuration), the RESTful Data API provides access for managing Rego policies; and the RESTful Query API facilitates advanced queries.

Those updates happen based on watch events from the Kube API Server, which does not guarantee any maximum delivery time.  If the Kube API Server handling the watch is under high load or otherwise impaired (e.g. requests to etcd take longer due to pending leader election in HA setup) then informer cache updates can be delayed significantly.  However, we did not find a way to reliably reproduce such condition.</p>\n<p>To bypass Kyverno policies, an attacker may try to exploit the described misbehavior by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>putting the Kube API Server under load before sending requests that Kyverno policies should be bypassed for.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>sending many request with a high rate to Kube API Server.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We did not try any of such attack vectors and therefore cannot prove their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>In our scenario the Kyverno policies apply to pods in \"sandbox\" namespaces identified as such by certain labels.  Those single-use namespaces and the pods therein are frequently created (and removed) by other controllers.  Therefore, Kyverno often receives admission webhooks for objects whose namespace has been created shortly before.</p>\n<h4 id=\"correction-proposal\">Correction Proposal</h4>\n<p>Function <code>GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister</code> in package <code>github.com/kyverno/kyverno/pkg/utils/engine</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/a96b1a4794b4d25cb0c6d72c05fc6355e95cf65c/pkg/utils/engine/labels.go#L10\">src</a>) should return an error instead of an empty label map in case it could not get the namespace object from the namespace lister.  This error will then cause admission webhook processing to fail, which lets Kubernetes fail the Kube API request if the policy's failure policy is <code>Fail</code> (a must for security-relevant policies).</p>\n<p>In addition, function <code>GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister</code> could retry (with deadline) to get the namespace object from the namespace lister in case of a NotFound error.  But as admission webhook processing time should be kept as short as possible, this might not be a good idea.</p>\n<p>Another option would be to perform a GET request for the namespace as a fallback in case the namespace lister returns a NotFound error.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>We did not find a way to reliably reproduce such case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Administrators attempting to enforce cluster security through Kyverno policies, but that allow less privileged users or service accounts to create/update/delete resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-jrr2-x33p-6hvc\">https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-jrr2-x33p-6hvc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/3ff923b7756e1681daf73849954bd88516589194\">https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/3ff923b7756e1681daf73849954bd88516589194</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46342\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46342</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3652\">https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3652</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jrr2-x33p-6hvc\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jrr2-x33p-6hvc</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS, the Driver didn’t correctly verify the permissions of the logging configuration file, potentially allowing an attacker with local access to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability affects Driver versions from 1.7.0 up to, but not including, 1.13.3. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 1.13.3.</p>\n<h1 id=\"vulnerability-details\">Vulnerability Details</h1>\n<p>When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS, the Driver reads logging configuration from a user-provided file. On Linux and macOS the Driver verifies that the configuration file can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition and failed to verify that the file owner matches the user running the Driver. This could allow a local attacker with write access to the configuration file or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location.</p>\n<h1 id=\"solution\">Solution</h1>\n<p>Snowflake released version 1.13.3 of the Go Snowflake Driver, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade to version 1.13.3.</p>\n<h1 id=\"additional-information\">Additional Information</h1>\n<p>If you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to Snowflake through our Vulnerability Disclosure Program hosted at HackerOne.
