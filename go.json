Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights:</p>\n<pre><code>B: {base: 100, latest: 1000}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1001}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1002}\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>If <code>B</code> fails to provide the latest block, <code>B</code> is removed and the <code>latest</code> height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes <code>latest</code> heights.</p>\n<p>The existing code hovewer doesn't check for the case where <code>B</code> first reports <code>latest</code> height <code>X</code> and immediately after height <code>Y</code>, where <code>X &gt; Y</code>.

Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights:</p>\n<pre><code>B: {base: 100, latest: 1000}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1001}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1002}\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>If <code>B</code> fails to provide the latest block, <code>B</code> is removed and the <code>latest</code> height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes <code>latest</code> heights.</p>\n<p>The existing code hovewer doesn't check for the case where <code>B</code> first reports <code>latest</code> height <code>X</code> and immediately after height <code>Y</code>, where <code>X &gt; Y</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>B: {base: 100, latest: 2000}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1001}\nB: {base: 100, latest: 1002}\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>A</code> will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. Even if <code>B</code> disconnects, the <code>latest</code> height (target height) won't be recalculated because <code>A</code> \"doesn't know where 2000\" came from per see.</p>\n<h4 id=\"impact-qualification\">Impact Qualification</h4>\n<p>This condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting a non-existing <code>latest</code> height, then reporting lower <code>latest</code> height and nodes which are syncing using <code>blocksync</code> protocol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The new CometBFT releases <a href=\"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1\">v1.0.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17\">v0.38.17</a> fix this issue.</p>\n<p>Unreleased code in the main is patched as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>When the operator notices <code>blocksync</code> is stuck, they can identify the peer from which that message with \"invalid\" height was received.
