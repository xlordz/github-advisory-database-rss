An attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server could modify API responses to use a specially tailored local executable path instead of HTTP URLs to resources.  This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary executables on the user's machine. </p>\n<p>In <code>2.12.1</code>, <code>Browser.Browse()</code> has been enhanced to allow and disallow a variety of scenarios to avoid opening or executing files on the filesystem without unduly impacting HTTP URLs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>URLs with <code>http://</code>, <code>https://</code>, <code>vscode://</code>, <code>vscode-insiders://</code> protocols are supported</li>\n<li>URLs with <code>file://</code> protocol are unsupported</li>\n<li>URLs matching files or directories on the filesystem are unsupported</li>\n<li>URLs matching executables in the user's path are unsupported</li>\n</ol>\n<p>URLs without protocols will be browsable if none of these other conditions apply.</p>\n<p>As we have more information about use cases, maintainers can expand these capabilities for an improved user experience that allows configuring allowed URL schemes and/or prompt the user for an unexpected user case and confirming whether to continue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Successful exploitation could cause users of the attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server to execute arbitrary commands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation-and-mitigation\">Remediation and Mitigation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade <code>go-gh</code> to <code>2.12.1</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cli/go-gh/security/advisories/GHSA-g9f5-x53j-h563\">https://github.com/cli/go-gh/security/advisories/GHSA-g9f5-x53j-h563</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cli/go-gh/commit/a08820a13f257d6c5b4cb86d37db559ec6d14577\">https://github.com/cli/go-gh/commit/a08820a13f257d6c5b4cb86d37db559ec6d14577</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48938\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48938</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g9f5-x53j-h563\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g9f5-x53j-h563</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
