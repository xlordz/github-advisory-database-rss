However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>In method <code>crl.(*FileCache).Set</code>, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated <code>notation</code> cache directory thanks <code>os.Rename</code>. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on <code>rename</code> syscall from the libc and as per the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html\">documentation</a>, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an <code>EXDEV</code> error, interpreted as <code>Cross device link not permitted error</code>.\nSome Linux distribution, like <code>RedHat</code> use a dedicated filesystem (<code>tmpfs</code>), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually <code>/tmp</code>) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash <code>notation</code>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure that the temporary file storage area (e.g., /tmp) is mounted on a different mount point than the user's 'notation' cache directory.</li>\n<li>Either disable the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) revocation check, or utilize certificates that exclusively support Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for revocation check.</li>\n<li>Try to verify a previously generated signature using the 'notation' tool.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The signature verification process is aborted as process crashes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation\">Remediation</h3>\n<p>The cache file should be created, written, then copied to the wanted final location, and finally removed. Additionally, this error shouldn't lead to a crash as it is not fatal and shouldn't prevent the rest of the program to properly continue</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp\">https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/commit/3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196\">https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/commit/3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51491\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51491</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html\">https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3382\">https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3382</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
