The behavior can be verified by seeing the API or UI still presenting images it should not or by viewing the data directly:  <code>bbolt get meta.db UserData &lt;user&gt;</code>, eg:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3491cbd2-c7d9-414d-bc33-3efc35ed0582\"></p>\n<p>Note this example also has duplicates due to group hierarchy changes that were left in the database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/project-zot/zot/security/advisories/GHSA-c9p4-xwr9-rfhx\">https://github.com/project-zot/zot/security/advisories/GHSA-c9p4-xwr9-rfhx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/project-zot/zot/commit/002ac62d8a15bf0cba010b3ba7bde86f9837b613\">https://github.com/project-zot/zot/commit/002ac62d8a15bf0cba010b3ba7bde86f9837b613</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23208\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23208</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/5e30fec65c49e3139907e2819ccb39b2e3bd784e/pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go#L1665\">https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/5e30fec65c49e3139907e2819ccb39b2e3bd784e/pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go#L1665</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9p4-xwr9-rfhx\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c9p4-xwr9-rfhx</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
