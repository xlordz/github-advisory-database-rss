The issue occurs when clients disconnect from the <code>/stream</code> endpoint, as the server fails to properly clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections while maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves improper channel cleanup in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\"><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/blob/main/docs/bugs/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8/test.py\">POC</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability affects all versions of Abacus prior to v1.4.0. The issue causes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Permanent unresponsiveness of the <code>/stream</code> endpoint after prolonged use</li>\n<li>Memory growth that stabilizes at a high level but prevents proper functionality</li>\n<li>Selective denial of service affecting only SSE connections while other endpoints remain functional</li>\n<li>Accumulated orphaned goroutines that cannot be garbage collected</li>\n<li>High resource consumption under sustained client connection/disconnection patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Systems running Abacus in production with client applications that frequently establish and terminate SSE connections are most vulnerable. The issue becomes particularly apparent in high-traffic environments or during connection stress testing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability has been patched in Abacus v1.4.0. The fix includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Implementing buffered channels to prevent blocking operations during cleanup</li>\n<li>Adding proper mutex-protected cleanup logic to ensure resources are released exactly once</li>\n<li>Implementing timeout protection for channel operations to prevent deadlocks</li>\n<li>Ensuring consistent cleanup when connections terminate unexpectedly</li>\n<li>Adding improved monitoring for client disconnections using request context</li>\n<li>Restructuring the event broadcasting system to safely handle client removal</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Users should upgrade to v1.4.0 or later versions as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>If upgrading is not immediately possible, the following workarounds can help mitigate the issue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Limit maximum connections</strong>: Configure your reverse proxy to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections to the <code>/stream</code> endpoints.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Implement request timeouts</strong>: Configure your infrastructure to terminate long-lived SSE connections after a reasonable period.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Restart regularly</strong>: Schedule regular restarts of the Abacus service to reclaim resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Monitor memory usage</strong>: Set up alerts for abnormal memory growth patterns.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Separate instance for SSE</strong>: Run a dedicated Abacus instance solely for handling SSE connections, allowing it to be restarted without affecting the main API functionality.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.golang.org/context\">Go Concurrency Patterns: Context</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/772.html\">CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control\">OWASP Top 10: Resource Exhaustion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/defer-panic-and-recover\">Resource Management in Go</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For More Information</h3>\n<p>Please contact the Abacus security team at <a href=\"mailto:abacus@jsn.cam\">abacus@jsn.cam</a> for additional information or to report further security issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/security/advisories/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8\">https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/security/advisories/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/commit/78fdb9b48b7f6d08ed0cd41077509c0a97071552\">https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/commit/78fdb9b48b7f6d08ed0cd41077509c0a97071552</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/commit/898ff1204e11317cc161240b660e63eed5a72b33\">https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/commit/898ff1204e11317cc161240b660e63eed5a72b33</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27421\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27421</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Probably not but it depends on your transfer middlewares</h4>\n<p>This patch is not state breaking unless you depend on transfer middlewares that deserialize and serialize acknowledgement packets before passing them to the transfer handler.  As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch. So if these are the only transfer middlewares you depend on, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-to-do-if-you-do-depend-on-ack-serializing-middleware\">What to do if you do depend on ack-serializing middleware</h4>\n<p>In the unlikely case that you depend on middlewares that serialize ack packets and you do not update them when you apply this patch, all transfers that are handled by the middleware will fail (or experience other unexpected behavior) if the serialization approach differs from the transfer app's. If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.</p>\n<p>To update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: <code>transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON</code>, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:</p>\n<pre><code>import transfertypes \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types\"\ntransfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON\nfunc MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {\n    return transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&amp;ack)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade. So for absolute clarity: chains with these ack-serializing middlewares must do coordinated upgrades</p>\n<h4 id=\"why-we-retracted-the-earlier-patch-in-favor-of-this-approach\">Why we retracted the earlier patch in favor of this approach</h4>\n<p>We retracted the releases of ibc-go we cut earlier today because these broke all transfer middlewares that deserialized then re-serialized receive packets differently than the transfer app. It turned out that this was a common pattern (unlike serializing/deserializing ack packets), so widely used middlewares, including packet-forward-middleware, broke unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>In the new set of patches, we removed this constraint on how middlewares serialize receive packets, preventing this breakage. Only the serialization requirement on acknowledgement packets remains. This is convenient because this is the only constraint we had to add to fix the vulnerability, and middlewares that deserialize and serialize ack packets are much less common than ones that do so for receive packets. The constraint on receive packets was added for defense in depth.</p>\n<h4 id=\"testing-we-have-done-to-gain-more-confidence-in-this-release\">Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:</li>\n<li>Tested pfm v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>\n<li>Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>\n<li>Ran a patched node on mainnet on the cosmos hub and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM</li>\n<li>Ran a patched node on osmosis and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks\nThis is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>February 18, 2025, 4:54am PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program</li>\n<li>February 18, 2025, 6:56am PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team</li>\n<li>February 18, 2025, 8:15am PST: Core team completes validation of issue</li>\n<li>February 25, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Pre-notification delivered</li>\n<li>February 27, 2025, 8:00am PST / 17:00 CET: Patch made available</li>\n<li>February 27, 2025, 1:00pm PST: Patch re-release made available</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by swelf19 on HackerOne on February 18, 2025.

As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch.

If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.</p>\n<p>To update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: <code>transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON</code>, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:</p>\n<pre><code>import transfertypes \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types\"\ntransfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON\nfunc MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {\n    return transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&amp;ack)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade.

As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch.

If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.</p>\n<p>To update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: <code>transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON</code>, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:</p>\n<pre><code>import transfertypes \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types\"\ntransfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON\nfunc MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {\n    return transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&amp;ack)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade.
