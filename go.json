These GitHub CLI commands invoke <code>git</code> with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials\"><code>credential.helper</code></a> configuration variable for any host encountered.</p>\n<p>Prior to <code>2.63.0</code>, hosts other than GitHub.com and ghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokens sourced from the following environment variables before falling back to host-specific tokens stored within system-specific secured storage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN</code></li>\n<li><code>GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN</code></li>\n<li><code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> <em>when <code>CODESPACES</code> environment variable is set</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result being <code>git</code> sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules.</p>\n<p>In <code>2.63.0</code>, these GitHub CLI commands will limit the hosts for which <code>gh</code> acts as a credential helper to source authentication tokens. Additionally, <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Successful exploitation could lead to a third-party using leaked authentication tokens to access privileged resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation-and-mitigation\">Remediation and mitigation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade <code>gh</code> to <code>2.63.0</code></li>\n<li>Revoke authentication tokens used with the GitHub CLI: <ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens\">Personal access tokens</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-revoking-authorization-of-github-apps#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps\">GitHub CLI OAuth app</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Review your personal <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-security-log\">security log</a> and any relevant <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/identifying-audit-log-events-performed-by-an-access-token\">audit logs</a> for actions associated with your account or enterprise</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-jwcm-9g39-pmcw\">https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-jwcm-9g39-pmcw</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwcm-9g39-pmcw\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jwcm-9g39-pmcw</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The server is considered to be in a privileged network position and can often reach exposed services that aren't readily available to clients due to network filtering. Leveraging such an attack vector, the attacker can have an impact on other services and potentially disclose information or have other nefarious effects on the system.\nThe /api/dev-console/proxy/internet endpoint on the OpenShit Console allows authenticated users to have the console's pod perform arbitrary and fully controlled HTTP(s) requests. The full response to these requests is returned by the endpoint.\nWhile the name of this endpoint suggests the requests are only bound to the internet, no such checks are in place. An authenticated user can therefore ask the console to perform arbitrary HTTP requests from outside the cluster to a service inside the cluster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6538\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6538</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6538\">https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6538</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2296057\">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2296057</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v3w7-g6p2-mpx7\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v3w7-g6p2-mpx7</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Invalid security proof due to incorrect operator</h3>\n<p>The original 2018 version of the DKLS had a typo in the OT extension protocol when computing the check value in the OT extension: the paper noted a XOR whereas it should be a field multiplication. This erroneous behavior was implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/blob/4d84aafb57b437da1b933db9a265fb7ce4e7c138/internal/ot/extended.go#L188\">in our code</a>. </p>\n<p>The proof of security fails in this case. No concrete attack is known, however.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/499.pdf\">2023 update</a> of the DKLS paper reported that typo and updated the protocol definition.</p>\n<p>As of 20241124, patching is in progress (branch <a href=\"https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/tree/otfix\">otfix</a>), but not merged to the main branch yes as the tests fail to pass. We're troubleshooting the issue and will merge into the main branch when it's resolved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Do not reuse an OT setup, to eliminate the secret recovery attack.</p>\n<p>Avoid using our implementation of the DKLS protocol until we patch it, and maybe avoid DKLS altogether.</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>Thank you to the Coinbase researchers Yi-Hsiu Chen and Samuel Ranellucci for discovering these issues and providing a comprehensive write-up.

If a malicious user can access the worker node which has this component, he/she can:</p>\n<p>For the create/patch/update verbs of daemonset resources, the malicious user can abuse it to create or modify a set of Pods to mount a high-privilege service account (e.g., the cluster-admin service account).

Additionally, the same information leaks into auditing logs when the audit level is set to equal or above 2.</p>\n<p>Application charts without sensitive data are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability impacts any Helm applications installed on a Rancher Manager cluster, regardless of it being installed via the Marketplace or using the helm cli.</p>\n<p>Please consult the associated <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK - Technique - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation</a> for further information about this category of attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Patched versions include Rancher Manager <code>2.9.5</code> and <code>2.8.10</code>. The fix ensures that all Helm values for each App are stored as Kubernetes Secrets. After the upgrade, users are recommended to rotate passwords and secrets that may have been leaked while using the affected versions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>No workarounds are available, therefore users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of Rancher Manager.\nFor deployments that can’t be upgraded in a timely fashion, admins are advised to limit the impact by reducing the amount of users who can get or list the Apps’ CRD.
