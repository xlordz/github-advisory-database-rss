The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation.</p>\n<p>Example attack scenario:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An attacker has stolen the private key for a key published in JWK Set.</li>\n<li>The publishers of that JWK Set remove that key from the JWK Set.</li>\n<li>Enough time has passed that the program using the auto-caching HTTP client found in <code>github.com/MicahParks/jwkset</code> v0.5.0-v0.5.21 has elapsed its <code>HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval</code> duration, causing a refresh of the remote JWK Set.</li>\n<li>The attacker is signing content (such as JWTs) with the stolen private key and the system has no other forms of revocation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version <code>v0.5.0</code> and fixed in <code>v0.6.0</code>. Upgrade to <code>v0.6.0</code> or later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation.
