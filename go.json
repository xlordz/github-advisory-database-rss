In some ImageMagick installations, this includes the capability to run Ghostscript to decode the image/file.</p>\n<p>If MP4 thumbnailers are enabled (also disabled by default), the same issue as above may occur with the ffmpeg installation instead.</p>\n<p>MMR uses a number of other decoders for all other file types when preparing thumbnails. Theoretical issues are possible with these decoders, however in testing they were not possible to exploit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.3.8\">MMR v1.3.8</a>. MMR now inspects the mimetype of media prior to thumbnailing, and picks a thumbnailer based on those results instead of relying on user-supplied values. This may lead to fewer thumbnails when obscure file shapes are used. This also helps narrow scope of theoretical issues with all decoders MMR uses for thumbnails.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Disabling the SVG, JPEGXL, and MP4 thumbnail types in the MMR config prevents the decoders from being invoked. Further disabling uncommon file types on the server is recommended to limit risk surface. </p>\n<p>Containers and other similar technologies may also be used to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in external decoders, like ImageMagick and ffmpeg. </p>\n<p>Some installations of ImageMagick may disable \"unsafe\" file types, like PDFs, already. This option can be replicated to other environments as needed. ffmpeg may be compiled with limited decoders/codecs. The Docker image for MMR disables PDFs and similar formats by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>A similar issue was discovered in Synapse: <a href=\"https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-vp6v-whfm-rv3g\">https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-vp6v-whfm-rv3g</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/security/advisories/GHSA-rcxc-wjgw-579r\">https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/security/advisories/GHSA-rcxc-wjgw-579r</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.3.8\">https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.3.8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56515\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56515</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rcxc-wjgw-579r\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rcxc-wjgw-579r</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Instances using a file-backed store or those which self-host an S3 storage system are therefore vulnerable to a disk fill attack. Once the disk is full, authenticated users will be unable to upload new media, resulting in denial of service.</p>\n<p>For instances configured to use a cloud-based S3 storage option, this could result in high service fees instead of a denial of service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>MMR 1.3.5 introduces a new default-on \"leaky bucket\" rate limit to reduce the amount of data a user can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but does limit an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data.</p>\n<p>Operators should note that the leaky bucket implementation introduced in MMR 1.3.5 requires the IP address associated with the request to be forwarded, to avoid mistakenly applying the rate limit to the reverse proxy instead.
