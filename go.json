MMR now inspects the mimetype of media prior to thumbnailing, and picks a thumbnailer based on those results instead of relying on user-supplied values. This may lead to fewer thumbnails when obscure file shapes are used. This also helps narrow scope of theoretical issues with all decoders MMR uses for thumbnails.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Disabling the SVG, JPEGXL, and MP4 thumbnail types in the MMR config prevents the decoders from being invoked. Further disabling uncommon file types on the server is recommended to limit risk surface. </p>\n<p>Containers and other similar technologies may also be used to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in external decoders, like ImageMagick and ffmpeg. </p>\n<p>Some installations of ImageMagick may disable \"unsafe\" file types, like PDFs, already.

Instances using a file-backed store or those which self-host an S3 storage system are therefore vulnerable to a disk fill attack.
