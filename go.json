It determines this by inspecting the <code>r.URL.Scheme</code> value.

It probably shouldn't be treated as an SMTP command; parsing it the same way is likely to result in odd behavior and could lead to other vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>I'm working on writing a PR to fix this vulnerability.  It'll include a unit test that will serve as a PoC on the current version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Any instance with <code>ProxyOn</code> enabled (<code>proxyon</code> in the JSON config) is affected.</p>\n<p>As far as I'm able to tell, the impact is limited to spoofing the <code>RemoteIP</code> field.  This isn't ideal, but it probably has less practical impact on an MTA than, say, a web server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/phires/go-guerrilla/security/advisories/GHSA-c2c3-pqw5-5p7c\">https://github.com/phires/go-guerrilla/security/advisories/GHSA-c2c3-pqw5-5p7c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/phires/go-guerrilla/commit/7673947f2d5204a135d7ae0b7f80759e548abee6\">https://github.com/phires/go-guerrilla/commit/7673947f2d5204a135d7ae0b7f80759e548abee6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31135\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31135</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2c3-pqw5-5p7c\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2c3-pqw5-5p7c</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
