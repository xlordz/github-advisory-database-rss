Each pod cleanup involves executing a <code>kill</code> instruction using the Kubernetes <code>exec</code> API, triggering the conditions for the panic. This can be seen when the tests mark the pods as complete, but the workflow itself never completes. Observing the controller logs when this happens shows the panic and restart of the controller every few seconds. In a setup with exponential backoff (e.g. a Kubernetes Pod) this is enough to reliably cause crashes enough to extend this backoff significantly and leave other workflows stalled.</p>\n<p>Because the restarted controller believes it has sent the <code>kill</code> signal, it will wait indefinitely for the pod to terminate, which it never will, so the attack must constantly garbage-collect its own workflows with the <code>argo terminate</code> command, otherwise the maximum concurrently running workflows will be reached. A more sophisticated attack could detect when the workflow has been signaled to clean up and terminate it then instead of relying on a simple timer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>A malicious user with access to create workflows can continually submit workflows that do nothing except create and then clean up multiple daemon pods, resulting in a crash-loop that prevents other users' workflows from running. This can be done with only a handful of pods and very little cpu and memory, meaning typical multi-tenant Kubernetes controls such as Pod count and resource quotas are not effective at preventing it.</p>\n<p>Because the panic log does not in any way suggest that the issue has anything to do with the daemon pods, and an attacker could easily disguise these daemon pods as part of a genuine workflow, it would be difficult for administrators to discover the root cause of the DoS and the individuals responsible to remove their access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13641\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13641</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/524406451f4dfa57bf3371fb85becdb56a2b309a\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/524406451f4dfa57bf3371fb85becdb56a2b309a</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/ce7f9bfb9b45f009b3e85fabe5e6410de23c7c5f/workflow/metrics/metrics_k8s_request.go#L75\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/ce7f9bfb9b45f009b3e85fabe5e6410de23c7c5f/workflow/metrics/metrics_k8s_request.go#L75</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Additionally, a new setting, <code>UnprivilegedJailUser</code>, has been introduced to manage this behavior, allowing users to opt-out if they need to run drivers in a more privileged context.</li>\n<li>Limit the devices copied to the jail directory to a minimal set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fixing node driver registration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>NewPlugin(driver)</code> function in the <code>rancher/machine</code> module has been updated to allow setting the UID and GID for starting the plugin server. If the environment variables <code>MACHINE_PLUGIN_UID</code> and <code>MACHINE_PLUGIN_GID</code> are set, their values will be used to configure the user credentials for launching the plugin server. </li>\n<li>Rancher now sets these environment variables with a non-root UID and GID before invoking the <code>NewPlugin(driver)</code> function and then unsets them after retrieving the creation flags.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Improvements on driver package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>driver</code> package has been revised to verify that the downloaded driver binary is a regular file.</li>\n<li>The <code>driver</code> package has been revised to verify that the target file in the downloaded tar file is a regular file.</li>\n<li>The <code>driver</code> package now executes the downloaded driver binary within a jail, with a default timeout of 5 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The helm package has been updated to ensure appropriate permissions are set on the generated kubeconfig file.</li>\n<li>The <code>nodeConfig</code> package has been updated to ensure proper permissions are applied when extracting the node configuration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patched versions include releases <code>2.7.16</code>, <code>2.8.9</code> and <code>2.9.3</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>If you can't upgrade to a fixed version, please make sure that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Drivers are only executed from trusted sources.</li>\n<li>The use of Admins/Restricted Admins is limited to trusted users.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to the <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy\">SUSE Rancher Security team</a> for security related inquiries.</li>\n<li>Open an issue in the <a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose\">Rancher</a> repository.</li>\n<li>Verify with our <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/\">support matrix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/\">product support lifecycle</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h99m-6755-rgwc\">https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h99m-6755-rgwc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h99m-6755-rgwc\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h99m-6755-rgwc</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
