Each pod cleanup involves executing a <code>kill</code> instruction using the Kubernetes <code>exec</code> API, triggering the conditions for the panic. This can be seen when the tests mark the pods as complete, but the workflow itself never completes. Observing the controller logs when this happens shows the panic and restart of the controller every few seconds. In a setup with exponential backoff (e.g. a Kubernetes Pod) this is enough to reliably cause crashes enough to extend this backoff significantly and leave other workflows stalled.</p>\n<p>Because the restarted controller believes it has sent the <code>kill</code> signal, it will wait indefinitely for the pod to terminate, which it never will, so the attack must constantly garbage-collect its own workflows with the <code>argo terminate</code> command, otherwise the maximum concurrently running workflows will be reached. A more sophisticated attack could detect when the workflow has been signaled to clean up and terminate it then instead of relying on a simple timer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>A malicious user with access to create workflows can continually submit workflows that do nothing except create and then clean up multiple daemon pods, resulting in a crash-loop that prevents other users' workflows from running. This can be done with only a handful of pods and very little cpu and memory, meaning typical multi-tenant Kubernetes controls such as Pod count and resource quotas are not effective at preventing it.</p>\n<p>Because the panic log does not in any way suggest that the issue has anything to do with the daemon pods, and an attacker could easily disguise these daemon pods as part of a genuine workflow, it would be difficult for administrators to discover the root cause of the DoS and the individuals responsible to remove their access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13641\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13641</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/524406451f4dfa57bf3371fb85becdb56a2b309a\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/524406451f4dfa57bf3371fb85becdb56a2b309a</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/ce7f9bfb9b45f009b3e85fabe5e6410de23c7c5f/workflow/metrics/metrics_k8s_request.go#L75\">https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/ce7f9bfb9b45f009b3e85fabe5e6410de23c7c5f/workflow/metrics/metrics_k8s_request.go#L75</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47827\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47827</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghjw-32xw-ffwr</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
