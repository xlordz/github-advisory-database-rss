Additional validation was added to prevent this condition from happening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The new CometBFT releases <a href=\"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1\">v1.0.1</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17\">v0.38.17</a> fix this issue.</p>\n<p>Unreleased code in the main branch is patched as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>There are no known workarounds for this issue.

After upgrading, the validators then will eventually conclude the correct value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-deep-dive\">Technical Deep-Dive</h3>\n<p>When the next proposer creates a block, it is split into many block parts (64kB each). Each block part is then disseminated via p2p layer in a gossip fashion. The block part contains the following fields:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">type Part struct {\n    Index uint32            `json:\"index\"`\n    Bytes cmtbytes.HexBytes `json:\"bytes\"`\n    Proof merkle.Proof      `json:\"proof\"`\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Index</code> - represents the index of a block part</li>\n<li><code>Bytes</code> - the actual content</li>\n<li><code>Proof</code> - Merkle proof, which allows the receiving node to quickly verify that a <code>Part</code> is indeed a piece of the proposed block.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>Proof</code> contains the following fields:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-go\">type Proof struct {\n    Total    int64    `json:\"total\"`           // Total number of items.\n    Index    int64    `json:\"index\"`           // Index of item to prove.\n    LeafHash []byte   `json:\"leaf_hash\"`       // Hash of item value.\n    Aunts    [][]byte `json:\"aunts,omitempty\"` // Hashes from leaf's sibling to a root's child.\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the total number of leaves in the Merkle tree equals the number of parts in the proposed block. Previously, CometBFT did not validate the <code>Index</code> field and specifically that <code>Part.Index</code> must be equal to <code>Part.Proof.Index</code>. This leads to a condition where, it is possible to use the proof from a different part and CometBFT accept it, even though the proof proves the different part is a piece of the proposed block and not the part that the peer actually sent to us.</p>\n<p>This condition is problematic because: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>it would disseminate the invalid block part to its neighboring nodes (because it deemed it as correct)</li>\n<li>it would mark the block part as received and ask the neighboring nodes not to relay it in the future, making it impossible to receive the correct block part.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To address this, CometBFT was patched to verify that <code>Part.Index</code> is equal to <code>Part.Proof.Index</code>, preventing the above condition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>January 15, 2025, 12:12pm PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program</li>\n<li>January 15, 2025, 12:31pm PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team</li>\n<li>January 27, 2025, 11:28pm PST: Core team completes validation of issue</li>\n<li>January 31, 2024, 2:15pm PST: Pre-notification delivered</li>\n<li>February 3rd, 2024, 9:00am UTC+4: Patch made available</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue was reported by <a href=\"https://github.com/unknownfeature\">unknown_feature</a> to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 15, 2025.

The former is cluster wide, while the latter is namespaced.</p>\n<p>By being namespaced, the AdmissionPolicyGroup has a well constrained impact on cluster resources. Hence, it’s considered safe to allow non-admin users to create and manage these resources in the namespaces they own.\nKubewarden policies can be allowed to query the Kubernetes API at evaluation time; these types of policies are called “<a href=\"https://docs.kubewarden.io/reference/spec/context-aware-policies\">context aware</a>“.\nContext aware policies can perform list and get operations against a Kubernetes cluster. The queries are done using the ServiceAccount of the Policy Server instance that hosts the policy. That means that access to the cluster is determined by the RBAC rules that apply to that ServiceAccount.\nThe AdmissionPolicyGroup CRD allowed the deployment of context aware policies. This could allow an attacker to obtain information about resources that are out of their reach, by leveraging a higher access to the cluster granted to the ServiceAccount token used to run the policy.</p>\n<p>The impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges that have been granted to the ServiceAccount used to run the Policy Server and assumes that users are using the recommended best practices of keeping the Policy Server's ServiceAccount least privileged. By default, the Kubewarden helm chart grants access to the following resources (cluster wide) only: Namespace, Pod, Deployment and Ingress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>Starting from the 1.21.0 release, the AdmissionPolicyGroup CRD does not allow the definition of context aware policies. No modifications are needed neither for performing the upgrade nor afterwards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>On clusters running Kubewarden &lt; 1.21.0, the following Kubewarden policy can be applied to prevent the creation of AdmissionPolicyGroup resources that have access to Kubernetes resources:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1\nkind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: \"deny-admission-policy-groups-with-context-resources\"\nspec:\n  module: registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/cel-policy:latest\n  settings:\n    variables:\n      - name: hasContextAwareResources\n        expression: \"object.spec.policies.exists(p, has(object.spec.policies[p].contextAwareResources))\"\n      - name: isPendingDeletion\n        expression: \"has(object.metadata.deletionTimestamp)\"\n    validations:\n      - expression: \"!variables.hasContextAwareResources || variables.isPendingDeletion\"\n        message: \"AdmissionPolicyGroup has contextAwareResources defined\"\n  rules:\n    - apiGroups: [\"policies.kubewarden.io\"]\n      apiVersions: [\"v1\"]\n      operations: [\"CREATE\", \"UPDATE\"]\n      resources: [\"admissionpolicygroups\"]\n  mutating: false\n  backgroundAudit: true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the policy is applied, the <a href=\"https://docs.kubewarden.io/howtos/audit-scanner\">Kubewarden Audit Scanner</a> can be used to identify the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies that are violating this policy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory you can contact the Kubewarden team using the procedures described under the “<a href=\"https://docs.kubewarden.io/disclosure\">security disclosure</a>“ guidelines of the Kubewarden project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-756x-m4mj-q96c\">https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-756x-m4mj-q96c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24784\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24784</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/commit/51a88dfbb4c090ce0f76a22d98106518e0824d0b\">https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/commit/51a88dfbb4c090ce0f76a22d98106518e0824d0b</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-756x-m4mj-q96c\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-756x-m4mj-q96c</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This happens in the case of network congestion between the two sides.</p>\n<p>If you keep Session.sendCh full (fixed capacity of 64) for ConnectionWriteTimeout, but for less than the KeepAliveInterval + ConnectionWriteTimeout (which would kill the Session), Stream.Write will return ErrConnectionWriteTimeout. The state of the underlying Session or Stream is not modified. When this happens, the other side's Stream.Read call that's waiting for that write will never return because there's no timeout for this edge-case.</p>\n<p>Since no keep alive timed out, you can continue to use the Session once the network congestion is resolved, but that Stream.Read call will only return when the Session closes or the response shows up. Since the write call on the other side timed out the call to Stream.Read will never return.</p>\n<p>Any conditions that cause network writes to stall for 10-30 seconds can trigger this Denial of Service- extremely high CPU contention on either side of the connection, BGP reconvergence, etc. To resolve the Denial of Service issue, you have to re-establish the connections, which will usually require a hard restart of the service on either end of the connection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/golang/vulndb/issues/3408\">https://github.com/golang/vulndb/issues/3408</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/issues/142\">https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/issues/142</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/pull/143\">https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/pull/143</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-29qp-crvh-w22m\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-29qp-crvh-w22m</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
