The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted.\nBoth Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratify’s Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange. Validation relies upon registry domain validation against a pre-configured list of well-known ACR endpoints. EID token exchange will be executed only if at least one of the configured well-known domain suffixes (wildcard support included) matches the registry domain of the image reference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"credits\">Credits</h3>\n<p>The <code>ratify</code> project would like to thank Shiwei Zhang (@shizhMSFT) and Binbin Li (@binbin-li) for responsibly disclosing the issue and thank Binbin Li (@binbin-li) and Akash Singhal (@akashsinghal) for actively mitigating the issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/security/advisories/GHSA-44f7-5fj5-h4px\">https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/security/advisories/GHSA-44f7-5fj5-h4px</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/commit/84c7c48fa76bb9a1c9583635d1e90bc25b1a546c\">https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/commit/84c7c48fa76bb9a1c9583635d1e90bc25b1a546c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27403\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27403</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/commit/0ec0c08490e3d672ae64b1a220c90d5484f1c93f\">https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/commit/0ec0c08490e3d672ae64b1a220c90d5484f1c93f</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3511\">https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3511</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-44f7-5fj5-h4px\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-44f7-5fj5-h4px</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain. The following patch is in addition to the previous patch which now extends the same protection to all applications beyond transfer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0\">v7.10.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0\">v8.7.0</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>To prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel Opening as a workaround.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-on-re-release\">Notes on Re-Release</h3>\n<p>This is an extension of the previous patch, please update to the latest patch to get full coverage against the reported issue.</p>\n<h4 id=\"is-this-state-breaking\">Is this state breaking?</h4>\n<p>This patch is not state breaking unless an exploit is submitted before the patch is applied across the network in which case the chain will halt just as if it was unpatched. Thus, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner and encourage validators to patch as soon as possible in order to prevent any chain halts (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).</p>\n<h4 id=\"testing-we-have-done-to-gain-more-confidence-in-this-release\">Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:</li>\n<li>Tested PFM v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>\n<li>Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>\n<li>Ran a patched node on Cosmos Hub Mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM</li>\n<li>Ran a patched node on Osmosis mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks\nThis is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by swelf19 on HackerOne on February 18, 2025.
