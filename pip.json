The XGrammar advisory is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-67px-mjg3\">https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-67px-mjg3</a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://xgrammar.mlc.ai/docs/\">xgrammar</a> library is the default backend used by vLLM to support structured output (a.k.a. guided decoding). Xgrammar provides a required, built-in cache for its compiled grammars stored in RAM. xgrammar is available by default through the OpenAI compatible API server with both the V0 and V1 engines.</p>\n<p>A malicious user can send a stream of very short decoding requests with unique schemas, resulting in an addition to the cache for each request. This can result in a Denial of Service by consuming all of the system's RAM.</p>\n<p>Note that even if vLLM was configured to use a different backend by default, it is still possible to choose xgrammar on a per-request basis using the <code>guided_decoding_backend</code> key of the <code>extra_body</code> field of the request with the V0 engine.
