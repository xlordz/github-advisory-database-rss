            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as short as a single character.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>When an email messaging provider is enabled and a new user account is created in the system, an invite email containing a special link is sent to the new user's email address. This link directs the new user to a page where they can set their initial password. While the user interface implements password complexity checks, these validations are only performed client-side. The underlying <code>/api/v1/user/accept-invite</code> API endpoint does not implement the same password policy validations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability allows an invited user to set an extremely weak password for their own account during the initial account setup process. Therefore that specific user's account can be compromised easily by an attacker guessing or brute forcing the password.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version <code>2.50.0</code>. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>There are no workarounds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"severity\">Severity</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability has been assigned a severity of LOW.</p>\n<p>Using CVSS v3.1 it could be scored as <code>CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N</code> (5.7 Medium/Moderate), but the likelihood of a user bypassing client-side password complexity rules to set their own password is very low.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-v7vm-rhmg-8j2r\">https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-v7vm-rhmg-8j2r</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/ce664da46ab7f86d29583ebc34f2ff776f0aa6c2\">https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/ce664da46ab7f86d29583ebc34f2ff776f0aa6c2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v7vm-rhmg-8j2r\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v7vm-rhmg-8j2r</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An app installation made use of a <a href=\"https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield/#select\">Search UI component</a> with the <code>async</code> flag set to true (default: true),</li>\n<li>A user types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results, and</li>\n<li>That third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the <code>select-requester.invalid-response</code> error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application. </p>\n<h4 id=\"impact-for-saas-users\">Impact for SaaS Users</h4>\n<p>For Sentry SaaS users, we have confirmed that only a single application integration was impacted and the owner has rotated their Client Secret. We have also confirmed that no abuse of the leaked Client Secret has occurred. </p>\n<h4 id=\"potential-impact-for-self-hosted-users\">Potential Impact for Self-Hosted Users</h4>\n<p>Sentry self-hosted does not ship with any application integrations. This could only impact self-hosted users that maintain their own integrations. In that case, search for a <code>select-requester.invalid-response</code> event. Please note that this error was also shared with another event unrelated to this advisory so you will also need to review the parameters logged for each named event. You may review <a href=\"https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/4a448fbb0d0b416fef9ee0ab26579e0dc16f21b7/src/sentry/sentry_apps/external_requests/select_requester.py#L78-L123\">select_requester.py</a> for the instances where these errors can be generated.
