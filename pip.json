The vulnerability arises from the usage of <code>file_path = f\"{UPLOAD_DIR}/{file.filename}\"</code> without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the <code>file.filename</code> parameter to include directory traversal sequences, causing the resulting <code>file_path</code> to escape the intended <code>UPLOAD_DIR</code> and potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This can lead to unauthorized modifications of system binaries, configuration files, or sensitive data, potentially enabling remote command execution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7034\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7034</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://huntr.com/bounties/711beada-10fe-4567-9278-80a689da8613\">https://huntr.com/bounties/711beada-10fe-4567-9278-80a689da8613</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-crh6-pj8c-xrhc\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-crh6-pj8c-xrhc</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
