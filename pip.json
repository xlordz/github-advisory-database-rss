This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, where an unaware user can unintentionally perform sensitive actions by simply visiting a malicious site or through top-level navigation. The affected endpoints include /rag/api/v1/reset, /rag/api/v1/reset/db, /api/v1/memories/reset, and /rag/api/v1/reset/uploads. This impacts both the availability and integrity of the application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7035\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7035</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://huntr.com/bounties/2ac81740-410b-467a-9244-75d82a6f9e11\">https://huntr.com/bounties/2ac81740-410b-467a-9244-75d82a6f9e11</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p5vx-9hj8-cf4h\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p5vx-9hj8-cf4h</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
