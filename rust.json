however, as per the ActivityPub spec (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#security-considerations\">https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#security-considerations</a>), on the security considerations section at B.3, access to Localhost services should be prevented while running in production.\nThe library attempts to prevent Localhost access using the following mechanism

}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are multiple issues with the current anti-Localhost implementation: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>It does not resolve the domain address supplied by the user.</li>\n<li>The Localhost check is using only a simple comparison method while ignoring more complex malicious tampering attempts.</li>\n<li>It filters only localhost domains, without any regard for alternative local IP domains or other sensitive domains, such internal network or cloud metadata domains.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can reach the verify_url_valid function while sending a Webfinger request to lookup a user’s

user account from the GET parameter “resource” and sinks the domain directly into the hardcoded Webfinger URL (“{protocol}://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}”) without any additional checks.\nAfterwards the user domain input will pass into the “fetch_object_http_with_accept” function and finally into the security check on “verify_url_valid” function, again, without any form of sanitizing or input validation.\nAn adversary can cause unwanted behaviours using multiple techniques:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><em>Gaining control over the query’s path:</em></strong>\nAn adversary can manipulate the Webfinger hard-coded URL, gaining full control over the GET request domain, path and port by submitting malicious input like: hacker@hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#, which in turn will result in the following string:\nhttp[s]://hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}, directing the URL into another domain and path without any issues as the hash character renders the rest of the URL path unrecognized by the webserver.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Bypassing the domain’s restriction using DNS resolving mechanism:</em></strong>\nAn adversary can manipulate the security check and force it to look for internal services regardless the Localhost check by using a domain name that resolves into a local IP (such as: localh.st, for example), as the security check does not verify the resolved IP at all - any service under the Localhost domain can be reached.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em><strong>Bypassing the domain’s restriction using official Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs):</strong></em>\nIn the official DNS specifications, a fully qualified domain name actually should end with a dot.\nWhile most of the time a domain name is presented without any trailing dot, the resolver will assume it exists, however - it is still possible to use a domain name with a trailing dot which will resolve correctly.\nAs the Localhost check is mainly a simple comparison check - if we register a “hacker@localhost.” domain it will pass the test as “localhost” is not equal to “localhost.”, however the domain will be valid (Using this mechanism it is also possible to bypass any domain blocklist mechanism).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate a local HTTP server listening to port 1234 with a “secret.txt” file:\n<code>python3 -m http.server 1234</code></li>\n<li>Open the “main.rs” file inside the “example” folder on the activitypub-federated-rust project, and modify the “beta@localhost” string into “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@localh.st\">hacker@localh.st</a>:1234/secret.txt?something=1#”.</li>\n<li>Run the example using the following command:\n<code>cargo run --example local_federation axum</code></li>\n<li>View the console of the Python’s HTTP server and see that a request for a “secret.txt” file was performed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This proves that we can redirect the URL to any domain and path we choose.\nNow on the next steps we will prove that the security checks of Localhost and blocked domains can be easily bypassed (both checks use the same comparison mechanism).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Now open the “instance.rs” file inside the “example” folder and view that the domain “malicious.com” is blocked (you can switch it to any desired domain address).</li>\n<li>Change the same “beta@localhost” string into “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>” and run the example command to see that the malicious domain blocking mechanism is working as expected.</li>\n<li>Now change the “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>” string into  “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>.” string and re-initiate the example, view now that the check passed successfully.</li>\n<li>You can combine both methods on “localhost.” domain (or any other domain) to verify that the FQDNs resolving is indeed successful.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Due to this issue, any user can cause the server to send GET requests with controlled path and port in an attempt to query services running on the instance’s host, and attempt to execute a Blind-SSRF gadget in hope of targeting a known vulnerable local service running on the victim’s machine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fix-suggestion\">Fix Suggestion</h3>\n<p>Modify the domain validation mechanism and implement the following checks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resolve the domain and validate it is not using any invalid IP address (internal, or cloud metadata IPs) using regexes of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\nFor Implementation example of a good SSRF prevention practice you can review a similiar project such as “Fedify” (<a href=\"https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/src/runtime/url.ts\">https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/src/runtime/url.ts</a>) which handles external URL resource correctly.\nNote that it is still needed to remove unwanted characters from the URL. </li>\n<li>Filter the user’s input for any unwanted characters that should not be present on a domain name, such as #,?,/, etc.</li>\n<li>Perform checks that make sure the desired request path is the executed path with the same port.</li>\n<li>Disable automatic HTTP redirect follows on the implemented client, as redirects can be used for security mechanisms circumvention.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a

That applies to multi-user systems, or when an account is used to run software with reduced abilities. (Some programs may also treat broad write permissions to mean less validation is required.)</p>\n<p>This bug affects Unix-like systems but not Windows. The <code>gix clone</code> command is not believed to be affected, due to <a href=\"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/af704f57bb9480c47cdd393465264d586f1d4562/gitoxide-core/src/index/checkout.rs#L14-L172\"><code>checkout_exclusive</code></a>'s <a href=\"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/af704f57bb9480c47cdd393465264d586f1d4562/gitoxide-core/src/index/checkout.rs#L61\">use</a> of <code>destination_is_initially_empty: true</code>. Specialized uses in which repositories are known never to have any files marked executable are unaffected. Repositories that no untrusted users can access, due to not having the ability to traverse the directories to them or due to sufficiently restrictive ACLs, are likewise unaffected.</p>\n<p>The default value of <code>destination_is_initially_empty</code> is <code>false</code>, so some applications may be affected even if they don't attempt checkouts in nonempty directories. The 0777 permissions are applied to files that are created earlier in the same checkout, as well as those that already existed, regardless of their prior permissions. On preexisting files, 0777 is set <em>even if <a href=\"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/8d84818240d44e1f5fe78a231b5d9bffd0283918/gix-worktree-state/src/checkout/mod.rs#L54-L58\"><code>overwrite_existing</code></a> is <code>false</code></em>, as that prevents the checkout from changing file contents but not permissions.</p>\n<p>Files not tracked/staged as executable are not checked out with insecure permissions. Such a file that previously existed keeps its old permissions. However, this may include executable permissions that no longer match repository metadata, as well as undesired write permissions acquired from a previous vulnerable checkout. <code>set_mode(0o777)</code> clears other bits, so the bug is not exacerbated by the presence of setuid/setgid bits.

To batch this check, multiple polynomial evaluation claims are combined using a random linear combination. Prior to v4.0.0, the individual evaluation claims were not observed into the challenger before sampling the coefficient for the random linear combination. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by observing all the evaluation claims into the challenger correctly inside of Plonky3.</p>\n<p>This bug was found by Lev Soukhanov and Onur Kilic, and we have worked closely with the Plonky3 team to mitigate this vulnerability. We will be deprecating all previous versions and freezing their verifiers to ensure that versions with the vulnerability will not be used in production.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/security/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m\">https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/security/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
