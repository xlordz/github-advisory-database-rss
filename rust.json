The following alternative mitigations have been identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rebuild locally with runtime overflow checks disabled</li>\n<li>Rebuild locally using a fixed version of the <code>ring</code> dependency (0.17.12 or later).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"detail\">Detail</h3>\n<p>The upstream advisory describes a crash in the implementation of the QUIC protocol that can be induced by a specially-crafted packet, and which happens naturally approximately every 1 in 2**32 packets sent and/or received.</p>\n<p>The crash only happens when runtime overflow checking is enabled. Note that the upstream advisory describes the overflow check causing this issue as \"unwanted\". Their response, to remove the overflow check in one place, does not introduce any additional issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>During qcp file transfer sessions, it is possible for an attacker to send a specially-crafted packet that could trigger this issue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In that case, and only if qcp was built with runtime overflow checks enabled, the effect is a Rust panic which immediately aborts the transfer. There is no additional impact on system resources at either end, nor on other file transfers in progress.</li>\n<li>As qcp runs a separate process for every connected user, the impact of the attack is limited to a single session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The underlying issue may also affect particularly large file transfers. The maximum TLS packet size is 16KB, so 2**32 packets will transfer up to 68TB (including the protocol/retransmit overhead). Again, this is only the case if qcp was built with runtime overflow checks enabled.</p>\n<p>As of the time of writing, we are not aware of any reports of this issue being exploited.</p>\n<h4 id=\"additional-notes\">Additional notes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The qcp protocol itself does not rely on runtime overflow checks for its security.</li>\n<li>While QUIC servers are normally public-facing, <a href=\"https://docs.rs/qcp/latest/qcp/protocol/index.html\">qcp is a hybrid protocol</a> that first requires an authenticated ssh session in order to set up the QUIC session. The window of attackability is therefore reduced, though will depend on your usage profile.</li>\n<li>An additional layer of obscurity is provided by qcp using ephemeral, random port numbers for its QUIC traffic (subject to user configuration).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>Upstream advisories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html\">RUSTSEC-2025-0009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/crazyscot/qcp/security/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm\">https://github.com/crazyscot/qcp/security/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/RELEASES.md#version-01712-2025-03-05\">https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/RELEASES.md#version-01712-2025-03-05</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

user account from the GET parameter “resource” and sinks the domain directly into the hardcoded Webfinger URL (“{protocol}://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}”) without any additional checks.\nAfterwards the user domain input will pass into the “fetch_object_http_with_accept” function and finally into the security check on “verify_url_valid” function, again, without any form of sanitizing or input validation.\nAn adversary can cause unwanted behaviours using multiple techniques:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><em>Gaining control over the query’s path:</em></strong>\nAn adversary can manipulate the Webfinger hard-coded URL, gaining full control over the GET request domain, path and port by submitting malicious input like: hacker@hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#, which in turn will result in the following string:\nhttp[s]://hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}, directing the URL into another domain and path without any issues as the hash character renders the rest of the URL path unrecognized by the webserver.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Bypassing the domain’s restriction using DNS resolving mechanism:</em></strong>\nAn adversary can manipulate the security check and force it to look for internal services regardless the Localhost check by using a domain name that resolves into a local IP (such as: localh.st, for example), as the security check does not verify the resolved IP at all - any service under the Localhost domain can be reached.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em><strong>Bypassing the domain’s restriction using official Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs):</strong></em>\nIn the official DNS specifications, a fully qualified domain name actually should end with a dot.\nWhile most of the time a domain name is presented without any trailing dot, the resolver will assume it exists, however - it is still possible to use a domain name with a trailing dot which will resolve correctly.\nAs the Localhost check is mainly a simple comparison check - if we register a “hacker@localhost.” domain it will pass the test as “localhost” is not equal to “localhost.”, however the domain will be valid (Using this mechanism it is also possible to bypass any domain blocklist mechanism).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate a local HTTP server listening to port 1234 with a “secret.txt” file:\n<code>python3 -m http.server 1234</code></li>\n<li>Open the “main.rs” file inside the “example” folder on the activitypub-federated-rust project, and modify the “beta@localhost” string into “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@localh.st\">hacker@localh.st</a>:1234/secret.txt?something=1#”.</li>\n<li>Run the example using the following command:\n<code>cargo run --example local_federation axum</code></li>\n<li>View the console of the Python’s HTTP server and see that a request for a “secret.txt” file was performed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This proves that we can redirect the URL to any domain and path we choose.\nNow on the next steps we will prove that the security checks of Localhost and blocked domains can be easily bypassed (both checks use the same comparison mechanism).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Now open the “instance.rs” file inside the “example” folder and view that the domain “malicious.com” is blocked (you can switch it to any desired domain address).</li>\n<li>Change the same “beta@localhost” string into “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>” and run the example command to see that the malicious domain blocking mechanism is working as expected.</li>\n<li>Now change the “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>” string into  “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>.” string and re-initiate the example, view now that the check passed successfully.</li>\n<li>You can combine both methods on “localhost.” domain (or any other domain) to verify that the FQDNs resolving is indeed successful.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Due to this issue, any user can cause the server to send GET requests with controlled path and port in an attempt to query services running on the instance’s host, and attempt to execute a Blind-SSRF gadget in hope of targeting a known vulnerable local service running on the victim’s machine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fix-suggestion\">Fix Suggestion</h3>\n<p>Modify the domain validation mechanism and implement the following checks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resolve the domain and validate it is not using any invalid IP address (internal, or cloud metadata IPs) using regexes of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\nFor Implementation example of a good SSRF prevention practice you can review a similiar project such as “Fedify” (<a href=\"https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/src/runtime/url.ts\">https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/src/runtime/url.ts</a>) which handles external URL resource correctly.\nNote that it is still needed to remove unwanted characters from the URL. </li>\n<li>Filter the user’s input for any unwanted characters that should not be present on a domain name, such as #,?,/, etc.</li>\n<li>Perform checks that make sure the desired request path is the executed path with the same port.</li>\n<li>Disable automatic HTTP redirect follows on the implemented client, as redirects can be used for security mechanisms circumvention.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p><code>verify_dnskey_rrset()</code> will return <code>Ok(true)</code> if any record's public key matches a trust anchor. This results in <code>verify_rrset()</code> returning a <code>Secure</code> proof. This ultimately results in successfully verifying a response containing DNSKEY records. <code>verify_default_rrset()</code> looks up DNSKEY records by calling <code>handle.lookup()</code>, which takes the above code path. There's a comment following this that says \"DNSKEYs were already validated by the inner query in the above lookup\", but this is not the case. To fully verify the whole RRset of DNSKEYs, it would be necessary to check self-signatures by the trusted key over the other keys. Later in <code>verify_default_rrset()</code>, <code>verify_rrset_with_dnskey()</code> is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its <code>Proof</code> is returned.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <code>verify_dnskey_rrset()</code> returns <code>Ok(false)</code> if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to <code>verify_rrset()</code>, it will call <code>verify_default_rrset()</code>. The special handling for DNSKEYs in <code>verify_default_rrset()</code> will then call <code>verify_rrset_with_dnskey()</code> using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its <code>Proof</code>. If there are multiple KSK DNSKEYs in the RRset, then this leads to another authentication break. We need to either pass the authenticated DNSKEYs from the DS covering check to the RRSIG validation, or we need to perform this RRSIG validation of the DNSKEY RRset inside <code>verify_dnskey_rrset()</code> and cut <code>verify_default_rrset()</code> out of DNSKEY RRset validation entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>The proof of concepts have been integrated into the conformance test suite, as <code>resolver::dnssec::scenarios::bogus::bogus_zone_plus_trust_anchor_dnskey</code> and <code>resolver::dnssec::scenarios::bogus::bogus_zone_plus_ds_covered_dnskey</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>This impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4\">https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25188\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25188</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/commit/e118c6eec569f4340421f86ee0686714010c63e9\">https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/commit/e118c6eec569f4340421f86ee0686714010c63e9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
