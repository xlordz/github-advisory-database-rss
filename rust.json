            "content_html": "<p>Two denial of service vulnerabilities were found in ntpd-rs related to the handling of NTS cookies in our client functionality. Whenever an NTS source is configured and the server behind that source is sending zero-sized cookies or cookies larger than what would fit in our buffer size, ntpd-rs would crash. Only configured NTS sources can abuse these vulnerabilities. NTP sources or third parties that are not configured cannot make use of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>For zero-sized cookies: a division by zero would force an exit when the number of new cookies that would need to be requested is calculated. In ntpd-rs 1.5.0 a check was added to prevent the division by zero.</p>\n<p>For large cookies: while trying to send a NTP request with the cookie included, the buffer is too small to handle the cookie and an exit of ntpd-rs is forced once a write to the buffer is attempted. The memory outside the buffer would not be written to in this case. In ntpd-rs 1.5.0 a check was added that prevents accepting cookies larger than 350 bytes.</p>\n<p>Users of older versions of ntpd-rs are recommended to update to the latest version. If an update is impossible, it is recommended to only add NTS sources to ntpd-rs that are trusted to not abuse this bug.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-v83q-83hj-rw38\">https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-v83q-83hj-rw38</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/commit/10a103b471dae25ac598140df0c195b6531bf716\">https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/commit/10a103b471dae25ac598140df0c195b6531bf716</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/commit/37dd8d9a0faa03e7dfe3a4bf64953010f075c3e2\">https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/commit/37dd8d9a0faa03e7dfe3a4bf64953010f075c3e2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v83q-83hj-rw38\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v83q-83hj-rw38</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Later in verify_default_rrset(), verify_rrset_with_dnskey() is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its Proof is returned.</p>\n<p>Similarly, verify_dnskey_rrset() returns Ok(false) if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to verify_rrset(), it will call verify_default_rrset(). The special handling for DNSKEYs in verify_default_rrset() will then call verify_rrset_with_dnskey() using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its Proof. If there are multiple KSK DNSKEYs in the RRset, then this leads to another authentication break. We need to either pass the authenticated DNSKEYs from the DS covering check to the RRSIG validation, or we need to perform this RRSIG validation of the DNSKEY RRset inside verify_dnskey_rrset() and cut verify_default_rrset() out of DNSKEY RRset validation entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4\">https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0006.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0006.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v7pc-74h8-xq2h\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v7pc-74h8-xq2h</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

user account from the GET parameter “resource” and sinks the domain directly into the hardcoded Webfinger URL (“{protocol}://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}”) without any additional checks.\nAfterwards the user domain input will pass into the “fetch_object_http_with_accept” function and finally into the security check on “verify_url_valid” function, again, without any form of sanitizing or input validation.\nAn adversary can cause unwanted behaviours using multiple techniques:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><em>Gaining control over the query’s path:</em></strong>\nAn adversary can manipulate the Webfinger hard-coded URL, gaining full control over the GET request domain, path and port by submitting malicious input like: hacker@hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#, which in turn will result in the following string:\nhttp[s]://hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}, directing the URL into another domain and path without any issues as the hash character renders the rest of the URL path unrecognized by the webserver.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Bypassing the domain’s restriction using DNS resolving mechanism:</em></strong>\nAn adversary can manipulate the security check and force it to look for internal services regardless the Localhost check by using a domain name that resolves into a local IP (such as: localh.st, for example), as the security check does not verify the resolved IP at all - any service under the Localhost domain can be reached.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em><strong>Bypassing the domain’s restriction using official Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs):</strong></em>\nIn the official DNS specifications, a fully qualified domain name actually should end with a dot.\nWhile most of the time a domain name is presented without any trailing dot, the resolver will assume it exists, however - it is still possible to use a domain name with a trailing dot which will resolve correctly.\nAs the Localhost check is mainly a simple comparison check - if we register a “hacker@localhost.” domain it will pass the test as “localhost” is not equal to “localhost.”, however the domain will be valid (Using this mechanism it is also possible to bypass any domain blocklist mechanism).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate a local HTTP server listening to port 1234 with a “secret.txt” file:\n<code>python3 -m http.server 1234</code></li>\n<li>Open the “main.rs” file inside the “example” folder on the activitypub-federated-rust project, and modify the “beta@localhost” string into “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@localh.st\">hacker@localh.st</a>:1234/secret.txt?something=1#”.</li>\n<li>Run the example using the following command:\n<code>cargo run --example local_federation axum</code></li>\n<li>View the console of the Python’s HTTP server and see that a request for a “secret.txt” file was performed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This proves that we can redirect the URL to any domain and path we choose.\nNow on the next steps we will prove that the security checks of Localhost and blocked domains can be easily bypassed (both checks use the same comparison mechanism).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Now open the “instance.rs” file inside the “example” folder and view that the domain “malicious.com” is blocked (you can switch it to any desired domain address).</li>\n<li>Change the same “beta@localhost” string into “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>” and run the example command to see that the malicious domain blocking mechanism is working as expected.</li>\n<li>Now change the “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>” string into  “<a href=\"mailto:hacker@malicious.com\">hacker@malicious.com</a>.” string and re-initiate the example, view now that the check passed successfully.</li>\n<li>You can combine both methods on “localhost.” domain (or any other domain) to verify that the FQDNs resolving is indeed successful.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Due to this issue, any user can cause the server to send GET requests with controlled path and port in an attempt to query services running on the instance’s host, and attempt to execute a Blind-SSRF gadget in hope of targeting a known vulnerable local service running on the victim’s machine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fix-suggestion\">Fix Suggestion</h3>\n<p>Modify the domain validation mechanism and implement the following checks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resolve the domain and validate it is not using any invalid IP address (internal, or cloud metadata IPs) using regexes of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\nFor Implementation example of a good SSRF prevention practice you can review a similiar project such as “Fedify” (<a href=\"https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/src/runtime/url.ts\">https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/src/runtime/url.ts</a>) which handles external URL resource correctly.\nNote that it is still needed to remove unwanted characters from the URL. </li>\n<li>Filter the user’s input for any unwanted characters that should not be present on a domain name, such as #,?,/, etc.</li>\n<li>Perform checks that make sure the desired request path is the executed path with the same port.</li>\n<li>Disable automatic HTTP redirect follows on the implemented client, as redirects can be used for security mechanisms circumvention.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a
