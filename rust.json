However, the error involves mishandling of the secret key, and in principle this presents a security vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>PQClean does not have a release process, as it is a collection of implementations. If you obtained a HQC implementation from PQClean, please update to a version that includes the fixes proposed in <a href=\"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578\">https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578</a>. </p>\n<p>Please also <a href=\"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/SECURITY.md\">refer to our security policy</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Manually patching is always possible</p>\n<h3 id=\"further-details\">Further details</h3>\n<p>In the 2023/04/30 version of the HQC specification and reference implementation, an extra field (sigma) was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts. The logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated accordingly. As a result, sigma is treated as part of the public key. Later in the decapsulation call, a incorrectly constructed comparison check allows this error to go through undetected. Due to how these two bugs interfere with each other, the decapsulation function never uses sigma to perform implicit rejection; instead, it accepts malformed ciphertexts and returns shared secrets based on their decryptions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>This issue was first reported in OQS <a href=\"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7\">https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7</a>.

This affects general message parsing and decryption with symmetric keys.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Affected <code>rpgp</code> versions do not correctly set upper limits on the total reserved amount of memory when parsing long sequences of partial OpenPGP packets, which can grow to to several GiB in size. Additionally, up to 4GiB of memory is reserved for OpenPGP packets of fixed size with large length fields, even if less data is received. \nDepending on existing message size restrictions and available system resources, this can cause out-of-memory conditions and crash the <code>rpgp</code> process or cause other system instability through memory resource exhaustion when parsing crafted messages.</p>\n<p>Affected <code>rpgp</code> versions are susceptible to excessive memory allocation with values of up to 2TiB or long processing times for some decryption operations which involve the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9580.html#name-argon2\">Argon2 function</a>. An attacker can provide a valid <code>Symmetric Key Encrypted Session Key</code> packet (SKESK) which uses <code>Argon2</code> for String-to-Key hashing with parameters that are excessive, but within specification limits of the RFC9580 OpenPGP standard. Since <code>rpgp</code> did not further restrict the Argon2 parameters, this can cause out-of-memory conditions and crash the <code>rpgp</code> process. Under some conditions,   the memory resource exhaustion may trigger other system instability. Alternatively, this can make the program unresponsive via long computations. The attacker needs to trick a victim into attempting decryption, but does not require knowledge of the symmetric secret used by the victim.</p>\n<p>There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"versions-and-patches\">Versions and Patches</h3>\n<p>The impact details on the message parsing component varies with different versions. We've confirmed some of the problematic behavior on older versions such as <code>v0.10.0</code> and see all recent versions as affected in some form.  </p>\n<p>The affected <code>Argon2</code> functionality was introduced with <code>v0.12.0-alpha.1</code>, earlier versions are not vulnerable.</p>\n<p>The vulnerabilities have been fixed with version <code>0.14.2</code>.
