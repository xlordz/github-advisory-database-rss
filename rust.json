Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload.</p>\n<p>This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. The fix is included in the following FCOS releases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the <code>stable</code> stream: 41.20250302.3.2</li>\n<li>On the <code>testing</code> stream: 41.20250315.2.0</li>\n<li>On the <code>next</code> stream: 42.20250316.1.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>A workaround is to add the following polkit rule:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n    if (action.id == \"org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy\" ||\n        action.id == \"org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment\" ||\n        action.id == \"org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.cleanup\") {\n        if (subject.user != \"zincati\") {\n                return polkit.Result.NO;\n        }\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>to e.g. <code>/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/00-zincati-fix.rules</code> (it must sort earlier than <code>zincati.rules</code> lexicographically).</p>\n<p>Note that this rule will deny all non-root users other than <code>zincati</code> from using those actions. If you've added polkit rules to allow e.g. the <code>core</code> user or other users, you will need to adjust the policy (or make sure the ordering is appropriate).</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>This issue was introduced by <a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/28a43aa2c1edda091ba659677d73c13e6e3ea99d\">this commit</a>, and is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.30\">v0.0.30</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/security/advisories/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825\">https://github.com/coreos/zincati/security/advisories/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/01d8e89f799e6ba21bdf7dc668abce23bd0d8f78\">https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/01d8e89f799e6ba21bdf7dc668abce23bd0d8f78</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/28a43aa2c1edda091ba659677d73c13e6e3ea99d\">https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/28a43aa2c1edda091ba659677d73c13e6e3ea99d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.24\">https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.24</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.30\">https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.30</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27512\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27512</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The following alternative mitigations have been identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rebuild locally with runtime overflow checks disabled</li>\n<li>Rebuild locally using a fixed version of the <code>ring</code> dependency (0.17.12 or later).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"detail\">Detail</h3>\n<p>The upstream advisory describes a crash in the implementation of the QUIC protocol that can be induced by a specially-crafted packet, and which happens naturally approximately every 1 in 2**32 packets sent and/or received.</p>\n<p>The crash only happens when runtime overflow checking is enabled. Note that the upstream advisory describes the overflow check causing this issue as \"unwanted\". Their response, to remove the overflow check in one place, does not introduce any additional issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>During qcp file transfer sessions, it is possible for an attacker to send a specially-crafted packet that could trigger this issue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In that case, and only if qcp was built with runtime overflow checks enabled, the effect is a Rust panic which immediately aborts the transfer. There is no additional impact on system resources at either end, nor on other file transfers in progress.</li>\n<li>As qcp runs a separate process for every connected user, the impact of the attack is limited to a single session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The underlying issue may also affect particularly large file transfers. The maximum TLS packet size is 16KB, so 2**32 packets will transfer up to 68TB (including the protocol/retransmit overhead). Again, this is only the case if qcp was built with runtime overflow checks enabled.</p>\n<p>As of the time of writing, we are not aware of any reports of this issue being exploited.</p>\n<h4 id=\"additional-notes\">Additional notes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The qcp protocol itself does not rely on runtime overflow checks for its security.</li>\n<li>While QUIC servers are normally public-facing, <a href=\"https://docs.rs/qcp/latest/qcp/protocol/index.html\">qcp is a hybrid protocol</a> that first requires an authenticated ssh session in order to set up the QUIC session. The window of attackability is therefore reduced, though will depend on your usage profile.</li>\n<li>An additional layer of obscurity is provided by qcp using ephemeral, random port numbers for its QUIC traffic (subject to user configuration).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>Upstream advisories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html\">RUSTSEC-2025-0009</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/crazyscot/qcp/security/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm\">https://github.com/crazyscot/qcp/security/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/RELEASES.md#version-01712-2025-03-05\">https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/RELEASES.md#version-01712-2025-03-05</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
