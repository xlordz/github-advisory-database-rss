An issue was discovered in the safe API of <code>Linker::func_*</code> APIs. These APIs were previously not sound when one <code>Engine</code> was used to create the <code>Linker</code> and then a different <code>Engine</code> was used to create a <code>Store</code> and then the <code>Linker</code> was used to instantiate a module into that <code>Store</code>. Cross-<code>Engine</code> usage of functions is not supported in Wasmtime and this can result in type confusion of function pointers, resulting in being able to safely call a function with the wrong type.</p>\n<p>Triggering this bug requires using at least two <code>Engine</code> values in an embedding and then additionally using two different values with a <code>Linker</code> (one at the creation time of the <code>Linker</code> and another when instantiating a module with the <code>Linker</code>).</p>\n<p>It's expected that usage of more-than-one <code>Engine</code> in an embedding is relatively rare since an <code>Engine</code> is intended to be a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact of this issue is relatively small.</p>\n<p>The fix implemented is to change this behavior to <code>panic!()</code> in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using different <code>Engine</code> instances with a <code>Linker</code> is a programmer bug that <code>wasmtime</code> catches at runtime.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.30.0.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime and are using more than one <code>Engine</code> in your embedding it's recommended to instead use only one <code>Engine</code> for the entire program if possible. An <code>Engine</code> is designed to be a globally shared resource that is suitable to have only one for the lifetime of an entire process. If using multiple <code>Engine</code>s is required then code should be audited to ensure that <code>Linker</code> is only used with one <code>Engine</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"for-more-information\">For more information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach out to us on <a href=\"https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime\">the Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat</a></li>\n<li>Open an issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/\">the <code>bytecodealliance/wasmtime</code> repository</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/b39f087414f27ae40c44449ed5d1154e03449bff\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/b39f087414f27ae40c44449ed5d1154e03449bff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime\">https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39219\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39219</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0110.html\">https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0110.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/compare/0.29.0...0.30.0\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/compare/0.29.0...0.30.0</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/wasmtime/PYSEC-2021-322.yaml\">https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/wasmtime/PYSEC-2021-322.yaml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WAVBRYDDUIY2ZR3K3FO4BVYJKIMJ5TP7\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WAVBRYDDUIY2ZR3K3FO4BVYJKIMJ5TP7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2Z33FTXFQ6EOINVEQIP4DFBG53G5XIY\">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2Z33FTXFQ6EOINVEQIP4DFBG53G5XIY</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

This would result in Wasmtime treating arbitrary stack slots as <code>externref</code>s that needed to be rooted for GC. At the <em>next</em> GC, it would be determined that nothing was referencing these bogus <code>externref</code>s (because nothing could ever reference them, because they are not really <code>externref</code>s) and then Wasmtime would deallocate them and run <code>&lt;ExternRef as Drop&gt;::drop</code> on them.

A description from Cure53, who originally found the issue, is available:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The correct method to select a random polynomial would be to select all coefficients (including the most significant coefficient) uniformly in the range 0..255 (inclusive). Otherwise, knowledge that a coefficient in a polynomial cannot be 0 permits the exclusion of single byte values for the shared secret given one share less than required. [...] Exploiting this weakness necessitates sharing the same secret multiple times. In this scenario, an attacker could exclude an exponential number of values for each of the shared bytes until sufficiently few values remain for brute forcing.  Cure53 estimates that under ideal circumstances (e.g., a 2-out-of-N scheme) a shared secret can be reconstructed if the same secret has been distributed 500-1500 times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secrets that have been shared a low amount of times (ideally, once) would not be impacted. However, secrets that are repeatedly shared may be vulnerable, especially if the shares are still available, and should be rotated.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability does not impact reconstitution of secrets: secrets that have already been split can be recombined without issue.</p>\n<p>The flaw can be corrected by changing the lower bound of the polynomial coefficient range in the <code>sharks::math::random_polynomial</code> function to <code>0</code>.
