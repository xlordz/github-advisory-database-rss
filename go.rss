<p>There have been two upstream security advisories and associated patches published under <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v">ISA-2025-001</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg">ISA-2025-002</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v">ISA-2025-001</a></strong> affects the IBC-Go package., where non-deterministic JSON unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgements can result in a chain halt. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg">ISA-2025-002</a></strong> affects the Cosmos SDK package, where <code>x/group</code> can halt when erroring in <code>EndBlocker</code>.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>If unaddressed, this could result in a chain halt.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Validators, full nodes, and IBC relayers should upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v3.1.8">cheqd-node v3.1.8</a>. This upgrade does not require a software upgrade proposal on-chain and is meant to be non state-breaking.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain. The following patch is in addition to the previous patch which now extends the same protection to all applications beyond transfer.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0">v7.10.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0">v8.7.0</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>To prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel Opening as a workaround.</p>
<h3 id="notes-on-re-release">Notes on Re-Release</h3>
<p>This is an extension of the previous patch, please update to the latest patch to get full coverage against the reported issue.</p>
<h4 id="is-this-state-breaking">Is this state breaking?</h4>
<p>This patch is not state breaking unless an exploit is submitted before the patch is applied across the network in which case the chain will halt just as if it was unpatched. Thus, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner and encourage validators to patch as soon as possible in order to prevent any chain halts (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).</p>
<h4 id="testing-we-have-done-to-gain-more-confidence-in-this-release">Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:</li>
<li>Tested PFM v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on Cosmos Hub Mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on Osmosis mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks
This is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.</li>

Component: IBC-Go
Criticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per <a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1.2</a>)
Affected versions: IBC-Go &gt;= v7; Earlier IBC-Go versions MAY also be affected.
Affected users: Validators, Full nodes, IBC Middleware authors</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain. The following patch is in addition to the previous patch which now extends the same protection to all applications beyond transfer.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0">v7.10.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0">v8.7.0</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>To prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel Opening as a workaround.</p>
<h3 id="notes-on-re-release">Notes on Re-Release</h3>
<p>This is an extension of the previous patch, please update to the latest patch to get full coverage against the reported issue.</p>
<h4 id="is-this-state-breaking">Is this state breaking?</h4>
<p>This patch is not state breaking unless an exploit is submitted before the patch is applied across the network in which case the chain will halt just as if it was unpatched. Thus, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner and encourage validators to patch as soon as possible in order to prevent any chain halts (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).</p>
<h4 id="testing-we-have-done-to-gain-more-confidence-in-this-release">Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:</li>
<li>Tested PFM v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on Cosmos Hub Mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on Osmosis mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks
This is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6f-48ff-5xrw">An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements</a> that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain.</p>
<p>This an upstream dependency used in cheqd-node, rather than a custom module.</p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>Could result in a chain halt.</p>
<h2 id="patches">Patches</h2>
<p>Validators, full nodes, and IBC relayers should upgrade to <strong><a href="https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v3.1.7">cheqd-node v3.1.7</a></strong>. This upgrade does not require a software upgrade proposal on-chain and is meant to be non state-breaking.</p>

<p>Chains using affected versions of Packet Forward Middleware in their IBC Transfer stack are vulnerable to an attack in which there is a potential denial of service. This affects IBC transfers for any asset which is being transferred between another chain and its native chain.</p>
<p>We recommend upgrading as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS A STATE BREAKING CHANGE</strong></p>

<p>Versions <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/releases/tag/middleware%2Fpacket-forward-middleware%2Fv7.2.1">7.2.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/releases/tag/middleware%2Fpacket-forward-middleware%2Fv8.1.1">8.1.1</a> are patched.</p>
