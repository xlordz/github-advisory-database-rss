        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Name: ASA-2025-004: Non-deterministic JSON Unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgement can result in a chain halt
Component: IBC-Go
Criticality: Critical (Considerable Impact; Almost Certain Likelihood per <a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1.2</a>)
Affected versions: IBC-Go &gt;= v7; Earlier IBC-Go versions may also be affected.
Affected users: Validators, Full nodes, IBC Middleware authors</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.9.2">v7.9.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.6.1">v8.6.1</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>To prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel Opening as a workaround.</p>
<h3 id="notes-on-re-release">Notes on Re-Release</h3>
<h4 id="is-this-state-breaking-probably-not-but-it-depends-on-your-transfer-middlewares">Is this state breaking? Probably not but it depends on your transfer middlewares</h4>
<p>This patch is not state breaking unless you depend on transfer middlewares that deserialize and serialize acknowledgement packets before passing them to the transfer handler.  As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch. So if these are the only transfer middlewares you depend on, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).</p>
<h4 id="what-to-do-if-you-do-depend-on-ack-serializing-middleware">What to do if you do depend on ack-serializing middleware</h4>
<p>In the unlikely case that you depend on middlewares that serialize ack packets and you do not update them when you apply this patch, all transfers that are handled by the middleware will fail (or experience other unexpected behavior) if the serialization approach differs from the transfer app's. If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.</p>
<p>To update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: <code>transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON</code>, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>import transfertypes "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types"
transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON
func MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {
    return transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&amp;ack)
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade. So for absolute clarity: chains with these ack-serializing middlewares must do coordinated upgrades</p>
<h4 id="why-we-retracted-the-earlier-patch-in-favor-of-this-approach">Why we retracted the earlier patch in favor of this approach</h4>
<p>We retracted the releases of ibc-go we cut earlier today because these broke all transfer middlewares that deserialized then re-serialized receive packets differently than the transfer app. It turned out that this was a common pattern (unlike serializing/deserializing ack packets), so widely used middlewares, including packet-forward-middleware, broke unexpectedly.</p>
<p>In the new set of patches, we removed this constraint on how middlewares serialize receive packets, preventing this breakage. Only the serialization requirement on acknowledgement packets remains. This is convenient because this is the only constraint we had to add to fix the vulnerability, and middlewares that deserialize and serialize ack packets are much less common than ones that do so for receive packets. The constraint on receive packets was added for defense in depth.</p>
<h4 id="testing-we-have-done-to-gain-more-confidence-in-this-release">Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:</li>
<li>Tested pfm v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on mainnet on the cosmos hub and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on osmosis and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks
This is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.</li>

Component: IBC-Go
Criticality: Critical (Considerable Impact; Almost Certain Likelihood per <a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1.2</a>)
Affected versions: IBC-Go &gt;= v7; Earlier IBC-Go versions may also be affected.
Affected users: Validators, Full nodes, IBC Middleware authors</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.9.2">v7.9.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.6.1">v8.6.1</a></li>

<h4 id="is-this-state-breaking-probably-not-but-it-depends-on-your-transfer-middlewares">Is this state breaking? Probably not but it depends on your transfer middlewares</h4>
<p>This patch is not state breaking unless you depend on transfer middlewares that deserialize and serialize acknowledgement packets before passing them to the transfer handler.  As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch. So if these are the only transfer middlewares you depend on, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).</p>
<h4 id="what-to-do-if-you-do-depend-on-ack-serializing-middleware">What to do if you do depend on ack-serializing middleware</h4>
<p>In the unlikely case that you depend on middlewares that serialize ack packets and you do not update them when you apply this patch, all transfers that are handled by the middleware will fail (or experience other unexpected behavior) if the serialization approach differs from the transfer app's. If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.</p>
<p>To update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: <code>transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON</code>, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>import transfertypes "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types"
transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON
func MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {
    return transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&amp;ack)
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade. So for absolute clarity: chains with these ack-serializing middlewares must do coordinated upgrades</p>
<h4 id="why-we-retracted-the-earlier-patch-in-favor-of-this-approach">Why we retracted the earlier patch in favor of this approach</h4>
<p>We retracted the releases of ibc-go we cut earlier today because these broke all transfer middlewares that deserialized then re-serialized receive packets differently than the transfer app. It turned out that this was a common pattern (unlike serializing/deserializing ack packets), so widely used middlewares, including packet-forward-middleware, broke unexpectedly.</p>
<p>In the new set of patches, we removed this constraint on how middlewares serialize receive packets, preventing this breakage. Only the serialization requirement on acknowledgement packets remains. This is convenient because this is the only constraint we had to add to fix the vulnerability, and middlewares that deserialize and serialize ack packets are much less common than ones that do so for receive packets. The constraint on receive packets was added for defense in depth.</p>
<h4 id="testing-we-have-done-to-gain-more-confidence-in-this-release">Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:</li>
<li>Tested pfm v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on mainnet on the cosmos hub and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on osmosis and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks
This is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.</li>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An issue was discovered in IBC-Go's deserialization of acknowledgements that results in non-deterministic behavior which can halt a chain. Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain</p>

<h4 id="is-this-state-breaking-probably-not-but-it-depends-on-your-transfer-middlewares">Is this state breaking? Probably not but it depends on your transfer middlewares</h4>
<p>This patch is not state breaking unless you depend on transfer middlewares that deserialize and serialize acknowledgement packets before passing them to the transfer handler.  As far as we can tell, these middlewares are rare. For example, packet-forward-middleware and ibc-hooks, do not serialize ack packets in this way and therefore aren't broken by this patch. So if these are the only transfer middlewares you depend on, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).</p>
<h4 id="what-to-do-if-you-do-depend-on-ack-serializing-middleware">What to do if you do depend on ack-serializing middleware</h4>
<p>In the unlikely case that you depend on middlewares that serialize ack packets and you do not update them when you apply this patch, all transfers that are handled by the middleware will fail (or experience other unexpected behavior) if the serialization approach differs from the transfer app's. If you have such dependencies and do not update them, validators who apply the patch in a rolling manner will halt when they upgrade, and transfers processed by the middleware will just fail once everyone has upgraded.</p>
<p>To update these middlewares and avoid failing transfers or a chain halt, you will simply need to change the serialization approach in the middleware to use ibc-go's codec: <code>transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON</code>, rather than whatever you're doing today.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>import transfertypes "github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v10/modules/apps/transfer/types"
transfertypes.ModuleCdc.[Must]MarshalJSON
func MarshalAsIBCDoes(ack channeltypes.Acknowledgement) ([]byte, error) {
    return transfertypes.ModuleCdc.MarshalJSON(&amp;ack)
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you do make a change to the serialization approach, this will make the patch state breaking and you will need a coordinated upgrade. So for absolute clarity: chains with these ack-serializing middlewares must do coordinated upgrades</p>
<h4 id="why-we-retracted-the-earlier-patch-in-favor-of-this-approach">Why we retracted the earlier patch in favor of this approach</h4>
<p>We retracted the releases of ibc-go we cut earlier today because these broke all transfer middlewares that deserialized then re-serialized receive packets differently than the transfer app. It turned out that this was a common pattern (unlike serializing/deserializing ack packets), so widely used middlewares, including packet-forward-middleware, broke unexpectedly.</p>
<p>In the new set of patches, we removed this constraint on how middlewares serialize receive packets, preventing this breakage. Only the serialization requirement on acknowledgement packets remains. This is convenient because this is the only constraint we had to add to fix the vulnerability, and middlewares that deserialize and serialize ack packets are much less common than ones that do so for receive packets. The constraint on receive packets was added for defense in depth.</p>
<h4 id="testing-we-have-done-to-gain-more-confidence-in-this-release">Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release</h4>
<ul>
<li>In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:</li>
<li>Tested pfm v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on mainnet on the cosmos hub and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM</li>
<li>Ran a patched node on osmosis and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks
This is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A vulnerability in Rancher has been discovered, leading to a local user impersonation through SAML Authentication on first login.</p>
<p>The issue occurs when a SAML authentication provider (AP) is configured (e.g. Keycloak). A newly created AP user can impersonate any user on Rancher by manipulating cookie values during their initial login to Rancher. This vulnerability could also be exploited if a Rancher user (present on the AP) is removed, either manually or automatically via the <a href="https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-user-retention">User Retention feature</a> with delete-inactive-user-after.</p>
<p>More precisely, Rancher validates only a subset of input from the SAML assertion request; however, it trusts and uses values that are not properly validated. An attacker could then configure the saml_Rancher_UserID cookie and the saml_Rancher_Action cookie so that the user principal from the AP will be added to the user specified by the attacker (from saml_Rancher_UserID). Rancher can then be deceived by setting saml_Rancher_UserID to the admin's user ID and saml_Rancher_Action to testAndEnable, thereby executing the vulnerable code path and leading to privilege escalation.</p>
<p>Note that the vulnerability impacts all SAML APs available in Rancher. However the following Rancher deployments are not affected :
Rancher deployments not using SAML-based AP.
Rancher deployments using SAML-based AP, where all SAML users are already signed in and linked to a Rancher account.</p>
<p>Please consult the associated  <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK - Technique - Access Token Manipulation: Token Impersonation/Theft</a> for further information about this category of attack.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This vulnerability is addressed by adding the UserID claim to a JWT signed token, which is protected against tampering. </p>
<p>Patched versions include releases <code>v2.8.13</code>, <code>v2.9.7</code> and <code>v2.10.3</code>.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Rancher deployments that can't upgrade, could temporarily disable the SAML-based AP as a temporary workaround. However, upgrading is recommended.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A vulnerability in Rancher has been discovered, leading to a local user impersonation through SAML Authentication on first login.</p>
<p>The issue occurs when a SAML authentication provider (AP) is configured (e.g. Keycloak). A newly created AP user can impersonate any user on Rancher by manipulating cookie values during their initial login to Rancher. This vulnerability could also be exploited if a Rancher user (present on the AP) is removed, either manually or automatically via the <a href="https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-user-retention">User Retention feature</a> with delete-inactive-user-after.</p>
<p>More precisely, Rancher validates only a subset of input from the SAML assertion request; however, it trusts and uses values that are not properly validated. An attacker could then configure the saml_Rancher_UserID cookie and the saml_Rancher_Action cookie so that the user principal from the AP will be added to the user specified by the attacker (from saml_Rancher_UserID). Rancher can then be deceived by setting saml_Rancher_UserID to the admin's user ID and saml_Rancher_Action to testAndEnable, thereby executing the vulnerable code path and leading to privilege escalation.</p>
<p>Note that the vulnerability impacts all SAML APs available in Rancher. However the following Rancher deployments are not affected :
Rancher deployments not using SAML-based AP.
Rancher deployments using SAML-based AP, where all SAML users are already signed in and linked to a Rancher account.</p>
<p>Please consult the associated  <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK - Technique - Access Token Manipulation: Token Impersonation/Theft</a> for further information about this category of attack.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>This vulnerability is addressed by adding the UserID claim to a JWT signed token, which is protected against tampering. </p>
<p>Patched versions include releases <code>v2.8.13</code>, <code>v2.9.7</code> and <code>v2.10.3</code>.</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Rancher deployments that can't upgrade, could temporarily disable the SAML-based AP as a temporary workaround. However, upgrading is recommended.</p>

<p>A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where it is possible for an unauthenticated user to list all CLI authentication tokens and delete them before the CLI is able to get the token value. This effectively prevents users from logging in via the CLI when using rancher token as the execution command (instead of the token directly being in the kubeconfig). </p>
<p>Note that this token is not the kubeconfig token and if an attacker is able to intercept it they can't use it to impersonate a real user since it is encrypted.</p>
<p>This happens because for SAML-based authentication providers, the login flow from the CLI works by generating a link to be pasted in the browser, and then polling every 10 seconds for the <code>/v3-public/authTokens/&lt;token name&gt;</code> endpoint.  The <code>&lt;token name&gt;</code> is randomly generated by the CLI. Once the login flow succeeds, Rancher creates an auth token (with an encrypted token value). The CLI then deletes the authToken.</p>
<p>Rancher deployments using only the local authentication provider, or non-SAML-based authentication providers, are not impacted by this vulnerability. SAML-based users not using the CLI are also not impacted.</p>

<p>When parsing compact JWS or JWE input, go-jose could use excessive memory. The code used strings.Split(token, ".") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of '.' characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Version 4.0.5 fixes this issue</p>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Applications could pre-validate payloads passed to go-jose do not contain an excessive number of '.' characters.</p>
