<p>For users who deploy Hubble UI using either Cilium CLI or via the Cilium Helm chart, an insecure default <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header value could lead to sensitive data exposure. A user with access to a Hubble UI instance affected by this issue could leak configuration details about the Kubernetes cluster which Hubble UI is monitoring, including node names, IP addresses, and other metadata about workloads and the cluster networking configuration. In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, a victim would have to first visit a malicious page.</p>

<p>With careful use of the <code>--mount</code> flag in RUN instructions in Containerfiles, and by using either multi-stage builds with use of concurrently-executing build stages (e.g., using the <code>--jobs</code> CLI flag) or multiple separate but concurrently-executing builds, a malicious Containerfile can be used to expose content from the build host to the command being run using the RUN instruction.  This can be used to read or write contents using the privileges of the process which is performing the build.  When that process is a root-owned podman system service which is provided for use by unprivileged users, this includes the ability to read and write contents which the client should not be allowed to read and write, including setuid executables in locations where they can be later accessed by unprivileged users.</p>

<p>With careful use of the <code>--mount</code> flag in RUN instructions in Containerfiles, and by using either multi-stage builds with use of concurrently-executing build stages (e.g., using the <code>--jobs</code> CLI flag) or multiple separate but concurrently-executing builds, a malicious Containerfile can be used to expose content from the build host to the command being run using the RUN instruction.  This can be used to read or write contents using the privileges of the process which is performing the build.  When that process is a root-owned podman system service which is provided for use by unprivileged users, this includes the ability to read and write contents which the client should not be allowed to read and write, including setuid executables in locations where they can be later accessed by unprivileged users.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>HashiCorp’s go-slug library is vulnerable to a zip-slip style attack when a non-existing user-provided path is extracted from the tar entry. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-0377, is fixed in go-slug 0.16.3.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>HashiCorp’s go-slug shared library offers functions for packing and unpacking Terraform Enterprise compatible slugs. Slugs are gzip compressed tar files containing Terraform configuration files.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>When go-slug performs an extraction, the filename/extraction path is taken from the tar entry via the header.Name. It was discovered that the unpacking step improperly validated paths, potentially leading to path traversal, allowing an attacker to write an arbitrary file during extraction.</p>
<h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
<p>Consumers of the go-slug shared library should evaluate the risk associated with this issue in the context of their go-slug usage and upgrade go-slug to 0.16.3 or later.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Authd PAM module up to version 0.3.4 can allow broker-managed users to impersonate any other user managed by the same broker and perform any PAM operation with it, including authenticating as them.</p>
<p>This is possible using tools such as <code>su</code>, <code>sudo</code> or <code>ssh</code> (and potentially others) that, so far, do not ensure that the PAM user at the end of the transaction is matching the one who initiated the transaction.</p>
<p>Authd 0.3.5 fixes this by not allowing changing the user unless it was never set before in the PAM stack.</p>

<details>
<summary>Old report</summary>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>An user can access as another user using its own credentials</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>I feel we’ve a security issue that is due to the fact that we allow changing the user in the cases in which that’s already provided by PAM, I’ve not tested this using the entra-id broker but it’s reproducible with the example one, but unless I’m missing something it should be independent from the broker in use.</p>
<p>Basically, by going to the user selection page we allow to login as any user by entering the use own credentials.</p>
<p>See for example: <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/VIcjpDImomaGu0wxsJJxNdmlf">https://asciinema.org/a/VIcjpDImomaGu0wxsJJxNdmlf</a> or <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/CV3D1gaEhn2yclqSMKCnifYPo">https://asciinema.org/a/CV3D1gaEhn2yclqSMKCnifYPo</a>  </p>
<p>Basically it’s possible to logging in as <code>user1</code> using the credentials of <code>user2</code> or <code>user3</code>.</p>
<p>The issue doesn’t affect login or passwd, but it does affect <code>su</code> and <code>sshd</code>, since in both cases they don’t check if the <code>PAM_USER</code> changed before the final authentication.</p>
<p>Now, while those tools should likely be fixed to only read the PAM_USER once pam gave them the final ok, I think authd should not allow changing the user at all when it has been provided by PAM.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/5e30fec65c49e3139907e2819ccb39b2e3bd784e/pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go#L1665">SetUserGroups</a> is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasn't obvious to me if it were the case.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<p>Login with group claims, logout, remove the user from a group from at IdP and log in again, the API still grants access and the new list of groups is appended creating meaningless duplicate entries and no longer mathing the expected groups from the IdP. The behavior can be verified by seeing the API or UI still presenting images it should not or by viewing the data directly:  <code>bbolt get meta.db UserData &lt;user&gt;</code>, eg:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3491cbd2-c7d9-414d-bc33-3efc35ed0582"></p>
<p>Note this example also has duplicates due to group hierarchy changes that were left in the database.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP.</p>
