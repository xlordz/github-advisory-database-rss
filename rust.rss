        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During proof generation, the prover must observe all values sent to the verifier to generate valid Fiat-Shamir challenges. Prior to v3.0.0 the cumulative sum of the permutation argument was not observed when sampling zeta, which is a random challenge sampled to force the constraints to be true. In v3.0.0, this is fixed by observing the cumulative sum into the challenger, which can is done by observing the commit to the entire permutation trace.</p>
<p>While this vulnerability is theoretically present in v2.0.0 and below, exploiting it is quite a difficult task as the cumulative sum one can get from manipulation is essentially random. It requires practically infeasible amount of computation and deep knowledge of cryptographic attacks to carry out.</p>
<p>This issue was discovered during the audit of SP1 V3.0.0 and was officially fixed on October 17th. Out of abundance of caution, we will be deprecating all versions of SP1 before 3.0.0.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Note the traversal <code>../joernchen_was_here</code> in the patch. This now can be committed to a repository
using the modified <code>git</code> binary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir demo
cd demo
git init
./path/to/modified/git/git --exec-path=./path/to/modified/git am the_traversal.patch
rm ../joernchen_was_here # remove the file the modified git wrote
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when cloning that repository with <code>jj git clone</code> the path traversal will write above the worktree
directory, allowing arbitrary file writes.</p>
<p>I've attached a tar.gz with the demo repo so you don't have to mess with the patched Git at all. For
reproduction it should be sufficient to do <code>jj git clone demo.git</code> after unpacking the tarball.</p>
<p>The demo repository after being cloned with <code>jj</code> will create an empty file <code>joernchen_was_here</code> right next
to the <code>demo</code> directory to demonstrate the traversal.</p>

<p>Wasmtime's filesystem sandbox implementation on Windows blocks access to special device filenames such as "COM1", "COM2", "LPT0", "LPT1", and so on, however it did not block access to the special device filenames which use superscript digits, such as "COM¹", "COM²", "LPT⁰", "LPT¹", and so on. Untrusted Wasm programs that are given access to any filesystem directory could bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript digits, and through them gain access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports.</p>

<p><code>loona-hpack</code> suffers from the same vulnerability as the original <code>hpack</code> as documented in <a href="https://github.com/mlalic/hpack-rs/issues/11">https://github.com/mlalic/hpack-rs/issues/11</a> </p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>The original includes a very nice description of the problem, as well as an easy-enough fix for it.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<p>The original example pretty much still applies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use loona_hpack::Decoder;

pub fn main() {
    let input = &amp;[0x3f];
    let mut decoder = Decoder::new();
    let _ = decoder.decode(input);
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>From the original:
<code>All users who try to decode untrusted input using the Decoder are vulnerable to this exploit. A patched version of the crate is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hpack-patched) under the name hpack-patched. See [Cargo's documentation on overriding dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) for more information.</code></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Gnark recursion circuit constrains arithmetic over BabyBear when the native field of the ZKP circuit is the BN254 scalar field. Proper implementation of this logic requires range checking Bn254 values to be less than the BabyBear modulus.</p>
<p>In versions &lt; 1.2.0, functions like <code>InvF</code> and <code>InvE</code> used values generated by hints that were not appropriately range checked. These issues are resolved in versions 1.2.0 and higher, by adding range checks in the appropriate places. This code was covered under the original audit scope of the recursion circuit audit by Veridise, and both Veridise and Kalos revisited the code for similar issues and found no additional vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This issue was discovered by the Succinct team on September 3rd. The issue was fixed and resolved within 48 hours, and released with V1.2.0 (note that a later V2.0.0 release has the same contents as V1.2.0 to respect semver), with production SP1 users being notified and upgraded immediately. The V1.1.0 verifier was frozen on September 4th to ensure that no one uses versions of SP1 with this bug.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Previously, the worst case weight was always accounted as the block weight for all cases. In case of large EVM gas refunds, this can lead to block spamming attacks -- the adversary can construct blocks with transactions that have large amount of refunds or unused gases with reverts, and as a result inflate up the chain gas prices. This issue is fixed by properly refund unused weights after each EVM execution.</p>
<p>The impact of this issue is limited in that the spamming attack would still be costly for any adversary, and it has no ability to alter any chain state. </p>

<p>In the newly introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for <code>pallet-ethereum</code>, a large part of transaction validation logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a block.</p>
<p>The attack is limited in that the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is done again in the subsequent <code>pallet-evm</code> execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns, while they are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors.</p>

<p>A bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. It is recommended that you apply the patch as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you do not use MODEXP precompile in your runtime, then you are not impacted.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A low severity security issue was discovered affecting parsing of the RPC result of the exit reason in case of EVM reversion. In release build, this would cause the exit reason being incorrectly parsed and returned by RPC. In debug build, this would cause an overflow panic.</p>
<p>No action is needed unless you have a bridge node that needs to distinguish different reversion exit reasons and you used RPC for this.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Frontier's <code>modexp</code> precompile uses <code>num-bigint</code> crate under the hood. <a href="https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint/blob/6f2b8e0fc218dbd0f49bebb8db2d1a771fe6bafa/src/biguint/power.rs#L134">In the implementation</a>, the cases for modulus being even and modulus being odd are treated separately. Odd modulus uses the fast Montgomery multiplication, and even modulus uses the slow plain power algorithm. This gas cost discrepancy was not accounted for in the <code>modexp</code> precompile, leading to possible denial of service attacks.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>No fixes for <code>num-bigint</code> is currently available, and thus this advisory will be first fixed in the short term by raising the gas costs for even modulus, and in the long term fixing it in <code>num-bigint</code> or switching to another modexp implementation.</p>
<p>The short-term fix for Frontier is deployed at <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/1017">PR 1017</a>.</p>
<p>The recommendations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you anticipate malicious validators, it's recommended to issue an emergency runtime upgrade as soon as possible.</li>
<li>If you do not anticipate malicious validators, it's recommended to issue a normal runtime upgrade, as Substrate has builtin timeout protection when validators are building blocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>None.</p>

<p>A similar issue was presented in Geth's implementation and the fix can be found <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/420897">here</a>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A bug in <code>pallet-ethereum</code> can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in <code>pallet-ethereum</code> due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.</p>

<p>The <code>gix</code> and <code>ein</code> commands write pathnames and other metadata literally to terminals, even if they contain characters terminals treat specially, including ANSI escape sequences.

<p><code>gitoxide-core</code>, which provides most underlying functionality of the <code>gix</code> and <code>ein</code> commands, does not neutralize newlines, backspaces, or control characters—including those that form ANSI escape sequences—that appear in a repository's paths, author and committer names, commit messages, or other metadata. Such text may be written as part of the output of a command, as well as appearing in error messages when an operation fails.</p>
<p>ANSI escape sequences are of particular concern because, when printed to a terminal, they can change colors, including to render subsequent text unreadable; reposition the cursor to write text in a different location, including where text has already been written; clear the terminal; set the terminal title-bar text to arbitrary values; render the terminal temporarily unusable; and other such operations.</p>
<p>The effect is mostly an annoyance. But the author of a malicious repository who can predict how information from the repository may be accessed can cause files in the repository to be concealed or otherwise misrepresented, as well as rewrite all or part of error messages, or mimic error messages convincingly by repositioning the cursor and writing colored text.</p>
