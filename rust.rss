        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to prevent DoS situations due to infinite recursions, SurrealDB implements a limit of nested calls for both native functions and embedded JavaScript functions.</p>
<p>However, in SurrealDB instances with embedded scripting functions enabled, it was found that this limit can be circumvented by utilizing both at the same time. If a native function contains JavaScript which issues a new query that calls that function, the recursion limit is not triggered.</p>
<p>Once executed, SurrealDB will follow the path of infinite recursions until the system runs out of memory, prior to the recursion limit being triggered.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can only affect SurrealDB servers explicitly enabling the scripting capability with <code>--allow-scripting</code> or

<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>For SurrealDB instances with embedded scripting functions enabled, this attack could be used to perform a DoS attack on the server by an authenticated user. </p>

<p>Where SurrealDB is used as an application backend, ensure sanitisation of input at the application layer to prevent injection attacks.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The internal <code>Channel</code> type's <code>Drop</code> method has a race
which could, in some circumstances, lead to a double-free.
This could result in memory corruption.</p>
<p>Quoting from the
<a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1187#issue-2980761131">upstream description in merge request #1187</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that <code>dicard_all_messages</code> contained two paths that could lead to <code>head.block</code> being read but only one of them would swap the value. This meant that <code>dicard_all_messages</code> could end up observing a non-null block pointer (and therefore attempting to free it) without setting <code>head.block</code> to null. This would then lead to <code>Channel::drop</code> making a second attempt at dropping the same pointer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bug was introduced while fixing a memory leak, in
upstream <a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1084">MR #1084</a>,
first published in 0.5.12.</p>
<p>The fix is in

Component: tendermint-rs
Criticality: High (Catastrophic Impact; Rare Likelihood per <a href="https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md">ACMv1.2</a>)
Affected versions: &lt;= v0.40.2
Affected users: Everyone</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>tendermint-rs contains a critical vulnerability in its light client implementation due to insecure handling of corrupted validator sets. Because it doesn't check that the validator address is correctly derived from the validator's public key when counting votes, it is possible to spoof votes from other validators. The result is being able to construct the malicious block and cheat the light client. The light client will accept such a block, seemingly signed by 2/3+ majority.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>The new tendermint-rs release <a href="https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/releases/tag/v0.40.3">v0.40.3</a> fixes this issue.</p>
<p>Unreleased code in the main branch is patched as well.</p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wr2m-38xh-rpc9</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wr2m-38xh-rpc9"/>
        <updated>2025-04-08T17:39:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>An improper uploaded media ownership check can result in inadvertent deletion of media when a user is banned with content removal or purged. This can lead to deletion of media that was not uploaded by the banned/purged user. This also applies to purged communities, in which case all media posted in that community will get deleted without proper ownership check.
This is limited to media with an <code>image/*</code> content-type returned by pict-rs.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>Lemmy did not associate users with media uploads until version 0.19.0 (<a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3927">#3927</a>).
Back when the first parts of content purging were implemented for 0.17.0 (<a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/1809">#1809</a>), it was therefore not possible to properly identify media belonging to a specific user for situations in which this data should get erased from pict-rs, Lemmy's media storage backend.</p>
<p>Pict-rs deduplicates uploaded files transparently. As a result, it has two types of media deletion. A regular deletion will only remove the referenced alias, and if there are not other aliases pointing to the same file, the backing file will also be deleted. A purge on the other hand will delete all aliases pointing to the specified file, as well as the file itself.</p>
<p>The logic implemented in 0.17.0 iterated over media URLs related to users and communities when purging them and purged them from pict-rs. This results in a full deletion of the backing media, even if either the same URL was the result of an upload by a different user, or the same media being uploaded by another user with a different alias.
For user purges, Lemmy iterated over all posts they created and applied this to all media referenced in post URLs and post thumbnails. For community purges, this applied to all posts within this community.</p>
<p>Additionally, the deletion of user avatars, banners, as well as the media from all their posts was implemented when users were banned with content removal. This includes local bans and also bans received via federation, when a user gets banned on their home instance.</p>
<p>The function for purging images from pict-rs performs a check at the start to verify that the media <code>Content-Type</code> header returned by pict-rs starts with <code>image/</code>, which limits this to not affect other media types supported by Lemmy and pict-rs, such as videos.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<h4 id="instances-with-open-federation">Instances with open federation</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Lemmy instances has open federation, which means that this can be exploited remotely without any authentication.</p>
<h4 id="instances-with-limited-or-no-federation">Instances with limited or no federation</h4>
<p>Exploitation requires user interaction by an admin of the targeted instance or a federation-linked instance if federation is enabled.
It may also require authentication, as instances may not have open registrations.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="impact">Impact</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A vulnerability in Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Named fragments were being processed once per fragment spread in some cases during query validation, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused fragments were involved.</p>
<h2 id="fixmitigation">Fix/Mitigation</h2>
<p>Apollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler has been updated so that validation logic processes each named fragment only once, preventing redundant traversal.</p>
<h1 id="patches">Patches</h1>
<p>This has been remediated in <code>apollo-router</code> versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.</p>
<h1 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h1>
<p>The only known workaround is "Safelisting with IDs only" per <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#router-security-levels">Safelisting with Persisted Queries - Apollo GraphQL Docs</a>. The "Safelisting" security level is not sufficient, since that level allows freeform GraphQL queries to be sent to Apollo Router.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed certain queries to bypass configured operation limits, specifically due to integer overflow.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query's height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments.</p>
<h2 id="fixmitigation">Fix/Mitigation</h2>
<p>Logic was updated to ensure counter overflow is handled correctly and does not wrap around to 0.</p>
<h1 id="patches">Patches</h1>
<p>This has been remediated in <code>apollo-router</code> versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.</p>
<h1 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h1>

<p>A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically during named fragment expansion. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.</p>

<p>A new <strong>Query Fragment Expansion Limit</strong> metric has been introduced:</p>
