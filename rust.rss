        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In PyO3 0.23.0 the <code>PYO3_CONFIG_FILE</code> environment variable used to configure builds regressed such that changing the environment variable would no longer trigger PyO3 to reconfigure and recompile. In combination with workflows using tools such as <code>maturin</code> to build for multiple versions in a single build, this leads to Python wheels being compiled against the wrong Python API version.</p>
<p>All users who distribute artefacts for multiple Python versions are encouraged to update and rebuild with PyO3 0.23.3. Affected wheels produced from PyO3 0.23.0 through 0.23.2 are highly unstable and will crash the Python interpreter in unpredictable ways.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The library breaks the safety assumptions when using unsafe API <code>std::slice::from_raw_parts</code>. First, when using the API in iterator implementation (<code>TempFdArrayIterator.next</code>), generic type could be any type, which would create and pass a misaligned pointer to the unsafe API. Second, when validating the address, the code passed the type <code>c_void</code>, which could also be any type, leading to potential uninitialized memory exposure.  </p>
<p>Two unsound usages here highlight the necessity for developers to perform type checks before doing type conversion with unsafe API.  </p>
<p>The panic caused by the misalignment causes several downstream applications (e.g., <code>greptimedb</code>) to crash when using <code>pprof::report::ReportBuilder::build</code>.  </p>
<p>This was patched in 0.14.0.  </p>
<p>The developer also suggested moving to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof2">pprof2</a>.  </p>

        <id>https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4grw-m28r-q285</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4grw-m28r-q285"/>
        <updated>2024-12-05T19:05:50.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During a security audit, <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> discovered two vulnerabilities which allow attackers to trigger resource exhaustion vulnerabilities in <code>rpgp</code> by providing crafted messages. This affects general message parsing and decryption with symmetric keys.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Affected <code>rpgp</code> versions do not correctly set upper limits on the total reserved amount of memory when parsing long sequences of partial OpenPGP packets, which can grow to to several GiB in size. Additionally, up to 4GiB of memory is reserved for OpenPGP packets of fixed size with large length fields, even if less data is received. 
Depending on existing message size restrictions and available system resources, this can cause out-of-memory conditions and crash the <code>rpgp</code> process or cause other system instability through memory resource exhaustion when parsing crafted messages.</p>
<p>Affected <code>rpgp</code> versions are susceptible to excessive memory allocation with values of up to 2TiB or long processing times for some decryption operations which involve the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9580.html#name-argon2">Argon2 function</a>. An attacker can provide a valid <code>Symmetric Key Encrypted Session Key</code> packet (SKESK) which uses <code>Argon2</code> for String-to-Key hashing with parameters that are excessive, but within specification limits of the RFC9580 OpenPGP standard. Since <code>rpgp</code> did not further restrict the Argon2 parameters, this can cause out-of-memory conditions and crash the <code>rpgp</code> process. Under some conditions,   the memory resource exhaustion may trigger other system instability. Alternatively, this can make the program unresponsive via long computations. The attacker needs to trick a victim into attempting decryption, but does not require knowledge of the symmetric secret used by the victim.</p>
<p>There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.</p>
<h3 id="versions-and-patches">Versions and Patches</h3>
<p>The impact details on the message parsing component varies with different versions. We've confirmed some of the problematic behavior on older versions such as <code>v0.10.0</code> and see all recent versions as affected in some form.  </p>
<p>The affected <code>Argon2</code> functionality was introduced with <code>v0.12.0-alpha.1</code>, earlier versions are not vulnerable.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities have been fixed with version <code>0.14.2</code>. We recommend all users to upgrade to this version.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During a security audit, <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> discovered several reachable edge cases which allow an attacker to trigger <code>rpgp</code> crashes by providing crafted data.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>When processing malformed input, <code>rpgp</code> can run into Rust panics which halt the program.</p>
<p>This can happen in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing OpenPGP messages from binary or armor format</li>
<li>Decrypting OpenPGP messages via <code>decrypt_with_password()</code></li>
<li>Parsing or converting public keys</li>
<li>Parsing signed cleartext messages from armor format</li>
<li>Using malformed private keys to sign or encrypt</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the affected components, we consider most attack vectors to be reachable by remote attackers during typical use cases of the <code>rpgp</code> library. The attack complexity is low since the malformed messages are generic, short, and require no victim-specific knowledge.</p>
<p>The result is a denial-of-service impact via program termination. There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.</p>
<h3 id="versions-and-patches">Versions and Patches</h3>
<p>All recent versions are affected by at least some of the above mentioned issues. </p>
<p>The vulnerabilities have been fixed with version <code>0.14.1</code>. We recommend all users to upgrade to this version.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities existed in the <code>deno_doc</code> crate which lead to Self-XSS with <code>deno doc --html</code>.</p>
<h3 id="details--poc">Details &amp; PoC</h3>
<p>1.) XSS in generated <code>search_index.js</code></p>
<p><code>deno_doc</code> outputed a JavaScript file for searching. However, the generated file used <code>innerHTML</code> on unsanitzed HTML input.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_doc/blob/dc556c848831d7ae48f3eff2ababc6e75eb6b73e/src/html/templates/pages/search.js#L120-L144">https://github.com/denoland/deno_doc/blob/dc556c848831d7ae48f3eff2ababc6e75eb6b73e/src/html/templates/pages/search.js#L120-L144</a></p>
<p>2.) XSS via property, method and enum names</p>
<p><code>deno_doc</code> did not sanitize property names, method names and enum names.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The first XSS most likely didn't have an impact since <code>deno doc --html</code> is expected to be used locally with own packages.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The <code>gix</code> and <code>ein</code> commands write pathnames and other metadata literally to terminals, even if they contain characters terminals treat specially, including ANSI escape sequences. This sometimes allows an untrusted repository to misrepresent its contents and to alter or concoct error messages.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p><code>gitoxide-core</code>, which provides most underlying functionality of the <code>gix</code> and <code>ein</code> commands, does not neutralize newlines, backspaces, or control characters—including those that form ANSI escape sequences—that appear in a repository's paths, author and committer names, commit messages, or other metadata. Such text may be written as part of the output of a command, as well as appearing in error messages when an operation fails.</p>
<p>ANSI escape sequences are of particular concern because, when printed to a terminal, they can change colors, including to render subsequent text unreadable; reposition the cursor to write text in a different location, including where text has already been written; clear the terminal; set the terminal title-bar text to arbitrary values; render the terminal temporarily unusable; and other such operations.</p>
<p>The effect is mostly an annoyance. But the author of a malicious repository who can predict how information from the repository may be accessed can cause files in the repository to be concealed or otherwise misrepresented, as well as rewrite all or part of error messages, or mimic error messages convincingly by repositioning the cursor and writing colored text.</p>
<h3 id="poc">PoC</h3>
<p>On a Unix-like system in a POSIX-compatible shell, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git init misleading-path
cd misleading-path
touch "$(printf '\033]0;Boo!\007\033[2K\r\033[91mError: Repository is corrupted. Run \033[96mEVIL_COMMAND\033[91m to attempt recovery.\033[0m')"
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
</code></pre>
<p>In the repository—or, if desired, in a clone of it, to show that this is exploitable by getting a user to clone an untrusted repository—run this command, which outputs entries in a three-column form showing type, hash, and filename:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">gix tree entries
</code></pre>
<p>Although the output is of that form, it does not appear to be. Instead, the output in a terminal looks like this, colorized to appear to be an error message, with <code>EVIL_COMMAND</code> in another color, and with no other text:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Error: Repository is corrupted. Run EVIL_COMMAND to attempt recovery.
</code></pre>
<p>In some terminals, a beep or other sound will be made. In most terminals, the title bar text will be changed to <code>Boo!</code>, though in some shells this may be immediately undone when printing the prompt. These elements are included to showcase the abilities of ANSI escape sequences, but they are not usually themselves threats.</p>
<p>To see what is actually produced, <code>gix tree entries</code> can be piped to a command that displays special characters symbolically, such as <code>less</code> or <code>cat -v</code> if available.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>That shows the effect on <code>gix tree entries</code>, but various other commands are also affected, and the escape sequences and other special characters can also appear in non-path metadata, such as in the <code>user.name</code> used to create a commit.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>For users who do not clone or operate in clones of untrusted repositories, there is no impact.</p>
<p>Windows is much less affected than Unix-like systems due to limitations on what characters can appear in filenames, and because traditionally Windows terminals do not support as many ANSI escape sequences.</p>
<p>Because different <code>gix</code> and <code>ein</code> commands display different data in different formats, the author of a malicious repository must guess how it will be used, which complicates crafting truly convincing output, though it may be possible to craft a repository where <code>gix clone</code> fails to clone it but produces a misleading message.</p>
<p>Although this is mainly exploitable on systems <em>other</em> than Windows, in the ability to produce misleading output this superficially resembles CVE-2024-35197. But this is much more limited, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The misleading output can only be made to go where the application is already sending output. Redirection is not defeated, and devices to access cannot be chosen by the attacker.</li>
<li>The misleading output can only be take place <em>when</em> the application is already producing output. This limitation complicates the production of believable messages.</li>
<li>Only terminals are affected. Even if a standard stream is redirected to another file or device, these special characters would not have a special effect, unless echoed later without sanitization.</li>
<li>Reading and blocking cannot be performed.</li>
<li>Applications other than the gitoxide <code>gix</code> and <code>ein</code> executables are unaffected. The exception is if another application uses <code>gitoxide-core</code>. But this is explicitly discouraged in the <code>gitoxide-core</code> documentation and is believed to be rare.</li>

<p>Affected users who are unable to update may want to limit the ability of untrusted clients to run arbitrary SurrealQL queries in the affected versions of SurrealDB.

To limit the impact of the denial of service, SurrealDB administrators may also want to ensure that the SurrealDB process is running so that it can be automatically re-started after a crash.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roles for system users are stored as generic <code>Ident</code> values and converted as strings and into the <code>Role</code> enum whenever IAM operations are to be performed that require processing the user roles. This conversion expects those identifiers to only contain the values <code>owner</code>, <code>editor</code> and <code>viewer</code> and will return an error otherwise. However, the <code>unwrap()</code> method would be called on this result when implementing <code>std::convert::From&lt;&amp;Ident&gt; for Role</code>, which would result in a panic where a nonexistent role was used.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A privileged user with the <code>owner</code> role at any level in SurrealDB would be able to define a user with <code>DEFINE USER</code> with an nonexistent role, which would panic when being converted to a <code>Role</code> enum in order to perform certain IAM operations with that user. These operations included signing in with the user. This would crash the server, leading to denial of service.</p>
<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>
<p>Unexistent roles are no longer accepted during parsing when defining a user. Even when successfully associated with a user, referencing unexistent roles will no longer result in a panic and will instead throw an <code>InvalidRole</code> error.</p>

<li>Version 2.1.0 and later are not affected by this issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3>
<p>Affected users who are unable to update may want to limit access to users with the <code>owner</code> role at any level to trusted parties only.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <code>rand::time()</code> function in SurrealQL generates a random time from an optional range of two Unix timestamps.

<p>A client that is authorized to run queries in a SurrealDB server would be able to make repeated (in the order of millions) calls to <code>rand::time()</code> in order to reliably trigger a panic. This would crash the server, leading to denial of service.</p>
