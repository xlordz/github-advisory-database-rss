Some email clients and security tools (e.g., Outlook, virus scanners, and email previewers) may automatically follow these links, unintentionally confirming the account. This allows an attacker to register an account using another user’s email and potentially have it auto-confirmed by the victim’s email client.</p>\n<p>This does not allow attackers to take over or access existing accounts or private data. It is limited to account confirmation of new accounts only.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>A mitigation has been released in version <code>4.7.0</code>. You will also need to upgrade to <code>2.6.0</code> or later of <code>ash_authentication_phoenix</code> to take advantage of the autogenerated views for confirmation. The fix updates the confirmation flow to require explicit user interaction (such as clicking a button on the confirmation page) rather than performing the confirmation via a GET request. This ensures that automatic link prefetching or scanning by email clients does not unintentionally confirm accounts.</p>\n<p>To mitigate, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upgrade <code>ash_authentication</code> &gt;= <code>4.7.0</code></li>\n<li>Upgrade <code>ash_authentication_phoenix</code> &gt;= <code>2.6.0</code> (if using <code>ash_authentication_phoenix</code>)</li>\n<li>Set <code>require_interaction? true</code> in your confirmation strategy.</li>\n<li>Add <code>confirm_route</code> to your router, if using <code>ash_authentication_phoenix</code> <em>above</em> <code>auth_routes</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"setting-require_interaction-true\">Setting <code>require_interaction? true</code></h4>\n<p>modify your <code>confirmation</code> strategy like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elixir\">confirmation &lt;strategy_name&gt; do\n  ...\n  require_interaction? true\nend\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"adding-the-confirm_route-to-your-router\">Adding the <code>confirm_route</code> to your router</h4>\n<p>In order to use this new confirmation flow, you will need to add this to your router to get the desired behavior. It will add a new route to the new confirmation page LiveView. Note the <code>path</code> and <code>token_as_route_param?</code> options, required for keeping backwards compatibility with current defaults. You may need to adjust if you have changed those routes in some way.</p>\n<h5 id=\"important---above-auth_routes\">IMPORTANT - above <code>auth_routes</code></h5>\n<p>Make sure this goes <em>above</em> <code>auth_routes</code> if you are using the <code>path</code> option, and it begins with <code>/auth</code>,\nor whatever your configured <code>auth_routes_prefix</code> is. <code>auth_routes</code> greedily handles all routes at the\nconfigured path.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elixir\">confirm_route(\n  MyApp.Accounts.User,\n  &lt;confirmation_strategy_name&gt;,\n  auth_routes_prefix: \"/auth\",\n  overrides: [MyAppWeb.AuthOverrides, AshAuthentication.Phoenix.Overrides.Default],\n  # use these options to keep your currently issued confirmation emails compatible\n  # without the options below, the route will default to `/&lt;the_strategy_name&gt;/:token`\n  path: \"/auth/user/&lt;confirmation_strategy_name&gt;\",\n  token_as_route_param?: false\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Users should upgrade to version <code>4.7.0</code> as soon as possible, and set <code>require_interaction?</code> to <code>true</code> in their confirmation strategy. This will change the <code>GET</code> request generated for confirming to a <code>POST</code> request. </p>\n<p>If you upgrade to this version and do not set <code>require_interaction?</code> to <code>true</code>, compilation will be fail with a message linking to this advisory. This error can be bypassed if, for example, you are confident that you are not affected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p><em>Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?</em>\nYou can disable the confirmation routes and create your own live view. We highly advised that you upgrade and take advantage of the builtin views if possible. If you are not using the provided views, you will need to <em>add</em> a confirmation LiveView, that does a <code>POST</code> to the old confirmation url instead of a <code>GET</code>. You would do this by taking the token a parameter out of the link, and adding it as a hidden field to a form. That form would have no inputs, only a button that posts to the confirmation URL. If you are using Liveview, this would be done with <code>phx-trigger-action</code> and <code>phx-action</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/security/advisories/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787\">https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/security/advisories/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/commit/99ea38977fd4f421d2aaae0c2fb29f8e5f8f707d\">https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/commit/99ea38977fd4f421d2aaae0c2fb29f8e5f8f707d</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32782\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32782</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

If you did not use the new installer, then you are absolutely not affected.</p>\n<p>Additionally, unless you have implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application (in which case even cursory testing would have uncovered this issue), then you will not be significantly affected. </p>\n<p>The impact here for users is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For users using the magic link strategy, magic link tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. By default magic link tokens are valid for 10 minutes.</li>\n<li>For users of password resets in the password strategy, password reset tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. By default password reset tokens are valid for 3 days.</li>\n<li>For users of the confirmation add-on, confirmation tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. By default password reset tokens are valid for 3 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"patches\">Patches</h3>\n<p>The flaw is patched in version 4.4.9. Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader, so if you use <code>mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication</code> the necessary patch will be applied for you. Otherwise you can run the upgrader manually as described in the error message</p>\n<h4 id=\"example\">Example</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elixir\">[warning] Warning while compiling Tunez.Accounts.Token:\n\nThe `:jti` and `:token` options to the `:revoked?` action must allow nil values and it must return a `:boolean`.\n\nThis was an error in our igniter installer previous to version 4.4.9, which allowed revoked tokens to be reused.\n\nTo fix this, run the following command in your shell:\n\n    mix ash_authentication.upgrade 4.4.8 4.4.9\n\nOr:\n\n  - remove `allow_nil?: false` from these action arguments, and\n  - ensure that the action returns `:boolean`.\n\n  like so:\n\n    action :revoked?, :boolean do\n      description \"Returns true if a revocation token is found for the provided token\"\n      argument :token, :string, sensitive?: true\n      argument :jti, :string, sensitive?: true\n\n      run AshAuthentication.TokenResource.IsRevoked\n    end\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"workarounds\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Delete the generated <code>:revoked?</code> generic action in your token resource This will cause it to use the one internal to AshAuthentication which has always been correct. Alternatively,  manually make the changes described above.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<p>See the <code>#ash_authentication</code> channel on the Ash Discord.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references-1\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/security/advisories/GHSA-qrm9-f75w-hg4c\">https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/security/advisories/GHSA-qrm9-f75w-hg4c</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/commit/2dee55252df26fe3d990ff1199397cdcf1bfea8a\">https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/commit/2dee55252df26fe3d990ff1199397cdcf1bfea8a</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25202\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25202</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qrm9-f75w-hg4c\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qrm9-f75w-hg4c</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"summary\">Summary</h3>\n<p>Stark Bank is a financial technology company that provides services to simplify and automate digital banking, by providing APIs to perform operations such as payments and transfers. In addition, Stark Bank maintains a number of cryptographic libraries to perform cryptographic signing and verification. These popular libraries are meant to be used to integrate with the Stark Bank ecosystem, but are also accessible on popular package manager platforms in order to be used by other projects. The node package manager reports around 16k weekly downloads for the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/starkbank-ecdsa\">ecdsa-node</a> implementation while the Python implementation boasts over <a href=\"https://package.wiki/starkbank-ecdsa\">7.3M downloads in the last 90 days on PyPI</a>. A number of these libraries suffer from a vulnerability in the signature verification functions, allowing attackers to forge signatures for arbitrary messages which successfully verify with any public key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker can forge signatures on arbitrary messages that will verify for any public key. This may allow attackers to authenticate as any user within the Stark Bank platform, and bypass signature verification needed to perform operations on the platform, such as send payments and transfer funds. Additionally, the ability for attackers to forge signatures may impact other users and projects using these libraries in different and unforeseen ways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n<p>The (slightly simplified) ECDSA verification of a signature <em><strong>(r, s)</strong></em> on a hashed message <em><strong>z</strong></em> with public key <em><strong>Q</strong></em> and curve order <em><strong>n</strong></em> works as follows:</p>\n<p>The (slightly simplified) ECDSA verification of a signature <em><strong>(r, s)</strong></em> on a hashed message <em><strong>z</strong></em> with public key <em><strong>Q</strong></em> and curve order <em><strong>n</strong></em> works as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check that <em><strong>r</strong></em> and <em><strong>s</strong></em> are integers in the <em><strong>[1, n-1]</strong></em> range, return Invalid if not.</li>\n<li>Compute <em><strong>u<sub>1</sub> = zs<sup>-1</sup> mod n</strong></em> and <em><strong>u<sub>2</sub> = rs<sup>-1</sup> mod n</strong></em>.</li>\n<li>Compute the elliptic curve point <em><strong>(x, y) = u<sub>1</sub>G + u<sub>2</sub>Q</strong></em>, return Invalid if <em><strong>(x, y)</strong></em> is the point at infinity.</li>\n<li>Return Valid if <em><strong>r ≡ x mod n</strong></em>, Invalid otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ECDSA signature verification functions in the libraries listed above fail to perform the first check, ensuring that the r and s components of the signatures are in the correct range. Specifically, the libraries are not checking that the components of the signature are non-zero, which is an important check mandated by the standard, see X9.62:2005, Section 7.4.1/a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>If <em><strong>r’</strong></em> is not an integer in the interval <em><strong>[1, n-1]</strong></em>, then reject the signature.</li>\n<li>If <em><strong>s’</strong></em> is not an integer in the interval <em><strong>[1, n-1]</strong></em>, then reject the signature.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, consider the following excerpt of the verify function from the <a href=\"https://github.com/starkbank/ecdsa-python/blob/v2.0.0/ellipticcurve/ecdsa.py#L34-L41\">ecdsa-python implementation</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def verify(cls, message, signature, publicKey, hashfunc=sha256):\n    byteMessage = hashfunc(toBytes(message)).digest()\n    numberMessage = numberFromByteString(byteMessage)\n    curve = publicKey.curve\n    r = signature.r\n    s = signature.s\n    inv = Math.inv(s, curve.N)\n    u1 = Math.multiply(curve.G, n=(numberMessage * inv) % curve.N, N=curve.N, A=curve.A, P=curve.P)\n    u2 = Math.multiply(publicKey.point, n=(r * inv) % curve.N, N=curve.N, A=curve.A, P=curve.P)\n    add = Math.add(u1, u2, A=curve.A, P=curve.P)\n    modX = add.x % curve.N\n    return r == modX\n</code></pre>\n<p>In that code snippet, the values <code>r</code> and <code>s</code> are extracted from the signature without any range check. An attacker supplying a signature equal to <code>(r, s) = (0, 0)</code> will not see their signature rejected. Proceeding with the verification, this function computes the inverse of the <code>s</code> component. Note that the <code>Math.inv()</code> function returns zero when supplied with a zero input (even though 0 does not admit an inverse). The code then computes the values <code>u1 = inv * numberMessage * G</code> and <code>u2 = inv * r * Q</code>, but since <code>inv</code> is zero, <code>u1</code> and <code>u2</code> will both be zero, i.e., the point at infinity, regardless of the value of numberMessage (the message hash, which we called <em><strong>z</strong></em> above) and <em><strong>Q</strong></em> (the public key). Subsequently, the implementation computes the intermediary curve point add by adding up the two previously computed points, which again results in the point at infinity. The final line checks that the r-component of the signature is equal to the x-coordinate of the curve point, essentially checking that <code>0 == 0</code> for all any message and any public key. Therefore, a signature <code>(r, s) = (0, 0)</code> is deemed valid by the code for any message, and under any public key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommendation\">Recommendation</h3>\n<p>Users of the different Stark Bank ECDSA libraries should update to the latest versions.
